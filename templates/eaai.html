        Welcome to the Eleventh Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-21)!
<br><br>
        Saturday – Sunday, February 6-7, 2021
        <br><br><br>

        EAAI-21 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss issues and share resources related to teaching AI and using AI in education. Contributions address K-12, undergraduate, and post-graduate education. The program comprises the 2021 Outstanding Educator Award Lecture by Michael Wooldridge, a panel on Teaching Online and Blended AI Courses, a main track, a special track on Demos, Software Tools, and Activities for Teaching AI in K-12, a special track on Model AI Assignments, and the EAAI-21 Gin Rummy Undergraduate Research Challenge.

        <br><br>

        AAAI gratefully acknowledges a generous grant from AI Journal, which helped make this program possible.

<p><strong>[6:30-7:45am]  Talking to the Public about AI</strong><br>
<em>Michael Wooldridge - University of Oxford and Alan Turing Institute, London</em></p>
<p>Since everything went crazy in AI, around 2012, I, like many other members of our community, have frequently found myself put in the position of having to talk about our field to a non-specialist audience. I've been interviewed on TV and radio, and spoken to endless university committees, government committees, and industrial conferences. More recently, following the publication of my two popular science books (the Ladybird Expert Guide to AI [2018], and The Road to Conscious Machines [2020]), I've even begun speaking at a literary festivals (believe me, I never expected to be doing this as a PhD student studying multiagent systems back in 1989). In this talk, I will relate these experiences, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them – how our field is perceived, what people fear, hope, and expect from it, and how best to communicate excitement about the very real progress we've made recently with a realistic understanding of where we are and where we are going.</p>
<p><em>Michael Wooldridge is the winner of this year’s Outstanding Educator award. He is a Professor of Computer Science and Head of Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, and a programme director for AI at the Alan Turing Institute. He is a Fellow of the ACM, the Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI), and the European Association for AI (EurAI). From 2014-16, he was President of the European Association for AI, and from 2015-17 he was President of the International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI). As well as more than 400 technical articles on AI, he has published two popular science introductions to the field: The Ladybird Expert Guide to AI (2018), and The Road to Conscious Machines (Pelican, 2020).</em></p>

<p>This panel is composed of AI faculty with experience teaching online and blended classes. Many of us found ourselves teaching AI courses online for the first time last year, and even after COVID-19 subsides, higher education is likely to retain online components. How will we make the most of this challenge (and opportunity)? How do we engage and bond with students online? What are the best tools for AI courses? In a blended model, which components of a course can be done best online and which are best in person? Panelists will share what they’ve learned on these topics and more.</p>
<p><em>Ashok Goel is a Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Chief Scientist with Georgia Tech’s Center for 21st Century Universities. In 2014, he co-developed a Udacity course on Knowledge-Based AI; in 2016, his research laboratory developed Jill Watson, a virtual teaching assistant for automatically answering questions in online classes; and in 2019, he co-edited a volume on Blended Learning published by MIT Press. Ashok received AAAI’s Outstanding AI Educator Award in 2019, and the University System of Georgia’s Hall of Fame Faculty Award for Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi is a senior lecturer in computer science with specific interests in machine learning and AI applications, including education and healthcare. She has published in top quality venues including JMLR, TPAMI, AAAI,  ECML, PKDD, COLT, IJCAI, ECAI, CHILL, and AISTAT. She also has a genuine interest in education and teaching, particularly on how to translate complex topics and break up abstract concepts into a form understandable and engaging to students. Recently, she has been working on building education tools for auto-grading and self-learning to provide additional support to her students in computer science and discrete mathematics. Her EdX course on Artificial Intelligence has attracted over a quarter million learners from all over the world since 2017.</em></p>
<p><em>Mehran Sahami is the James and Ellenor Chesebrough Professor in Engineering and Associate Chair for Education in the Computer Science department at Stanford University. He is also the Robert and Ruth Halperin University Fellow in Undergraduate Education. He served as co-chair of the ACM/IEEE-CS joint task force on Computer Science Curricula 2013, is Past Chair of the ACM Education Board, and was appointed by the Governor of California to the state's Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan Advisory Panel.</em></p>
