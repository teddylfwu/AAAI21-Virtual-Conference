                        <p>In a world that is getting more and more used to the abundance and accessibility of historical data as a rich source for modeling, the sudden change of patterns caused by the ongoing pandemic puts in check the conventional way in which forecasting is done. How has industry adapted to that? This panel brings together data scientists, engineers, and business leaders who were at the forefront of such disruptions°™delivery, supply chain, and traveling°™and witnessed those challenges first hand.
