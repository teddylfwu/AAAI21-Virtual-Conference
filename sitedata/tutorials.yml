  title: 'Explainable AI for Societal Event Predictions: Foundations, Methods, and
    Applications'
  organizers: Songgaojun Deng, Yue Ning and Huzefa Rangwala
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The goal of this tutorial is to bring together data scientists, AI researchers, and social scientists to discuss research problems and challenges in computational event modeling. Traditional machine learning models for societal event forecasting focus on predictive performance using structured data. We present new directions of interpretable AI/ML models for predictive analysis in dynamic, heterogeneous, and multi-source event data. The tutorial will cover technical material related to event detection, forecasting, and precursor identification with assumed preliminary knowledge in supervised learning, deep learning, and temporal event modeling. First, we will introduce formal definitions of event prediction and event precursors, along with a brief discussion on the methods applied in this field. Next, we will present recently developed deep learning methods including dynamic graph convolutional networks in event forecasting and actor (participant) inference. Last, we will discuss real-world applications based on temporal event modeling.

  title: Deep Randomized Neural Networks
  organizers: Claudio Gallicchio
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a fundamental tool in the modern development of Machine Learning. Beyond the merits of the training algorithms, a great part of DNNs success is due to the inherent properties of their layered architectures, i.e., to the introduced architectural biases. In this tutorial, we explore recent classes of DNN models wherein the majority of connections are randomized or more generally fixed according to some specific heuristic. Limiting the training algorithms to operate on a reduced set of weights implies intriguing features. Among them, the extreme efficiency of the learning processes is undoubtedly a striking advantage with respect to fully trained architectures. Besides, despite the involved simplifications, randomized neural systems possess remarkable properties both in practice, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple domains, and theoretically, allowing to analyze intrinsic properties of neural architectures.
    <br />
    This tutorial covers all the major aspects regarding Deep Randomized Neural Networks, from feed-forward and convolutional neural networks, to dynamically recurrent deep neural systems for structures. The tutorial is targeted to both researchers and practitioners, from academia or industry, who are interested in developing DNNs that can be trained efficiently, and possibly embedded into low-powerful devices.
    <br />
    Requirements: basics on Machine Learning and DNNs.

  title: Efficient Neural Architecture Search
  organizers: Tejaswini Pedapati and Martin Wistuba
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    With the advances and success of deep learning technology in solving complex AI problems, the natural step forward lies in building systems that automate the decisions required for setting up a deep learning pipeline. Tackling this automation is not only crucial for speeding up the deployment of deep learning models, it also helps in expanding the capabilities of models to other challenging scenarios like modelling with limited data or modelling under resource constraints. This tutorial seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the approaches used in this regard by means of neural architecture search. It is also the first tutorial that strongly focuses on transfer and meta-learning, going beyond classic neural architecture search.
    <br />
    The tutorial is geared toward graduate students, AI researchers, and practitioners, who are interested in automating parts of their deep learning pipelines, want to learn about principles of automated machine learning and deep learning, and apply those principles to make their own work more effective and less arduous.
    <br />
    The prerequisite knowledge assumed of the audience includes basic understanding of deep learning, optimization, and machine learning concepts. Familiarity with some state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture can facilitate the understanding but is not required.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The tutorial will consist of four main components, each covered by one of the presenters, followed by a discussion session. We will start by introducing theories on an axiomatization of commonsense knowledge. Next, we will cover efforts to harmonize nodes and relations across heterogeneous commonsense sources, as well as the impact of such consolidation on downstream reasoning tasks. Thirdly, we will discuss how commonsense knowledge can be automatically extracted from text, as well as quantitatively and qualitatively contextualized. Then, we will discuss how large-scale models, such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5, learn to implicitly represent an abundance of commonsense knowledge from reading the web. Also, how this knowledge can be extracted through carefully-designed language prompting, or through fine-tuning on knowledge graph tuples. We will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of the way forward, and propose to combine language models, knowledge graphs, and axiomatization in the next-generation commonsense reasoning techniques.

    Tutorial'
  organizers: Rayid Ghani, Pedro Saleiro and Kit Rodolfa
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    There is a need for training AI researchers and practitioners on how to deal with bias and fairness in practice through the entire lifecycle of an AI system, from the early stages of a project up to maintaining the system in production. This tutorial will help participants learn how to think about overall fairness of an AI system, from project scoping (through informed discussions with stakeholders) to thinking about the right metrics (based on the use case context), to performing bias audits and exploring different bias reduction strategies, to continuous monitoring to assess the need for retraining.
    <br />
    The discussions, breakout sessions, and hands-on coding sessions will involve real-world case studies based on our work with over 100 government agencies and non-profits over the last several years and will include working through Python notebooks, taking the participants through each step of the process.
    <br />
    The tutorial will have the following prerequisites: 1) prior programming experience in Python, and 2) prior experience in machine learning, with an understanding of different types of ML models as well as experience building those models.

  title: Designing Agents' Preferences, Beliefs, and Identities
  organizers: Vincent Conitzer
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    We often assume that each agent has a well-defined identity, well-defined preferences over outcomes, and well-defined beliefs about the world. However, when designing agents, we in fact need to specify where the boundaries between one agent and another in the system lie, what objective functions these agents aim to maximize, and to some extent even what belief formation processes they use. What is the right way to do so? As more and more AI systems are deployed in the world, this question becomes increasingly important. In this tutorial, I will show how it can be approached from the perspectives of decision theory, game theory, social choice theory, and the algorithmic and computational aspects of these fields. (No previous background required.)

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    In the era of big data, data-driven methods have become increasingly popular. The superior performance of these data-driven approaches relies on large-scale labeled training data. But many real-world applications often face the "small (labeled) data" challenge. For example, precision medicine aims to provide tailored treatment or management plans to individual patients, but we only have data from a limited number of individuals (patients). For another example, smart city technologies aim at using data to make better decisions in applications such as transportation, security, and energy. But a city is a highly complex, interconnected, and dynamic system and we often do not have enough data from different sources to model a holistic view at the city scale.
    <br />
    In this tutorial, we will review the trending machine learning techniques for learning with small (labeled) data. These techniques are organized from three aspects: (1) providing a comprehensive review of recent studies about knowledge generalization, transfer, and sharing; (2) introducing the cutting-edge techniques which focus on incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning models; (3) discussing the small data challenges and solutions in real-world applications on precision medicine and smart city.

  title: Meta Learning
  organizers: Iddo Drori and Joaquin Vanschoren
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Meta-learning allows machines to learn to learn new algorithms. It is an emerging and fast developing research area within machine learning with implications for all AI research. Recent successes include automatic model discovery, few-shot learning, multi-task learning, meta-reinforcement learning, as well as teaching machines to read, learn and reason. Just as humans do not learn new tasks from scratch, but rather draw on what they learn before, meta-learning is key to efficient and robust learning. This tutorial will cover important mathematical foundations of the field and its applications, including key methods underlying current state of the art in this fast-paced field that is increasingly relevant for a broad range of AAAI attendees.
    <br />
    The intended audience comprises both AI researchers and practitioners. For AI researchers, this tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of existing methods and how they are combined in novel ways. We explore the interactions between the sub-fields of meta-learning, automated machine learning, transfer learning, adaptation, multi-task learning, and continual learning. For practitioners and attendees from industry, we explain how meta-learning enables novel applications, such as building AI systems that learn models from very small amounts of data, that learn across tasks to get increasingly better, and enable disruptive applications.

    <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being used in decisions and processes that are critical for individuals, businesses, and society, especially in areas such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education. Recent ethical challenges and undesirable outcomes associated with AI systems have highlighted the need for regulations, best practices, and practical tools to help data scientists and ML developers build AI systems that are secure, privacy-preserving, transparent, explainable, fair, and accountable – to avoid unintended and potentially harmful consequences and compliance challenges.
    <br />
    In this tutorial, we will present an overview of responsible AI, highlighting model explainability, fairness, and privacy in AI, key regulations/laws, and techniques/tools for providing understanding around AI/ML systems. Then, we will focus on the application of explainability, fairness assessment/unfairness mitigation, and privacy techniques in industry, wherein we present practical challenges/guidelines for using such techniques effectively and lessons learned from deploying models for several web-scale machine learning and data mining applications. We will present case studies across different companies, spanning many industries and application domains. Finally, based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research directions for the AI community.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Word vector embeddings have been shown to contain and amplify biases in data they are extracted from. Consequently, many techniques have been proposed to identify, mitigate, and attenuate these biases in word representations. In this tutorial, we will review a collection of state-of-the-art debiasing techniques. To aid this, we provide an open source web-based visualization tool and offer hands-on experience in exploring the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques change the underlying geometry, we decompose each technique into interpretable sequences of primitive operations and study their effect on the word vectors using dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration.

  title: 'Explaining Machine Learning Predictions: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and
    Opportunities'
  organizers: Himabindu Lakkaraju, Julius Adebayo and Sameer Singh
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    As machine learning is deployed in all aspects of society, it has become increasingly important to ensure stakeholders understand and trust these models. Decision-makers must have a clear understanding of the model behavior so they can diagnose errors and potential biases in these models and decide when and how to employ them. However, most accurate models that are deployed in practice are not interpretable, making it difficult for users to understand where the predictions are coming from, and thus, difficult to trust. Recent work on explanation techniques in machine learning offers an attractive solution: they provide intuitive explanations for “any” machine learning model by approximating complex machine learning models with simpler ones.
    <br />
    In this tutorial, we discuss several post hoc explanation methods, and focus on their advantages and shortcomings. We cover three families of techniques: (a) single instance gradient-based attribution methods (saliency maps), (b) model agnostic explanations via perturbations, such as LIME and SHAP, and (c) surrogate modeling for global interpretability, such as MUSE. For each of these approaches, we provide their problem setup, prominent methods, example applications, and finally, discuss their vulnerabilities and shortcomings. We hope to provide a practical and insightful introduction to explainability in machine learning.

  title: Topological Data Analysis in Document Classification
  organizers: Wlodek Zadrozny and Shafie Gholizadeh
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Topological Data Analysis (TDA) introduces methods that capture the underlying structure of shapes in data. Despite the old history in applied mathematics, utilization of topology in data science is relatively a new phenomenon. Within the last decade, TDA has been mostly examined in unsupervised machine learning tasks. As an alternative to the conventional algorithms, TDA has been often considered due to its capability to deal with high-dimensional data in different tasks including but not limited to clustering, dimensionality reduction or descriptive modeling. This tutorial will focus on applications of topological data analysis to text, and in particular to text classification. After introducing the fundamentals, we will show three ways in which topological information can be added to improve the accuracy of classification. More specifically, we explain three different methods of extracting topological features from textual documents, using as the underlying representations of text the two most popular methods, namely term frequency vectors and word embeddings, and also without using any conventional features. In addition, we show how even the simplest out of the box topological methods can be used to provide similarity judgments, e.g. topological plots of classical novels.

  title: 'AI for COVID-19: Battling the Pandemic with Computational Intelligence'
  organizers: Fei Wang
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Since the initial outbreak from January 2020 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has demonstrated a high transmission rate and a diverse set of clinical characteristics (e.g., high rate of hospital and intensive care unit admission rates, multi-organ dysfunction for critically ill patients due to hyperinflammation, thrombosis, etc.). To understand the disease mechanism of COVID-19 and develop effective control, treatment and prevention strategies, researchers from related disciplines are making tremendous efforts on different aspects including epidemiology and public health, biology and genomic medicine, as well as clinical care and patient management. This tutorial will summarize the efforts on battling the pandemic with artificial intelligence. In particular, I will focus on how AI methods can derive insights on the prediction, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 on the following 4 tasks: 1) disease spread forecasting and policy impact assessment from news reports, government documents, census, meteorology and climate data, etc.; 2) contact tracing and individual behavior modeling from mobile and sensor data; 3) drug research and development from biomedical literature and multi-omics data; 4) patient care and management from longitudinal clinical records. I will also summarize the implications and envision how AI can advance human healthcare in the post-pandemic era.

  title: From Explainability to Model Quality and Back Again
  organizers: Anupam Datta, Matt Fredrikson, Klas Leino, Kaiji Lu, Shayak Sen and
    Zifan Wang
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic view of the current knowledge relating to explainability to several key outstanding concerns regarding the quality of Machine Learning (ML) models; in particular, robustness, privacy, and bias. We will discuss the ways in which explainability can inform questions about these aspects of model quality, and how methods for improving them that are emerging from recent research in the AI, Security, Privacy, and Fairness communities can in turn lead to better outcomes for explainability. Through presentation and live demonstrations, we will discuss recent research results from these communities, as well as several open questions of interest to the AI community.
    <br />
    We aim to make these findings accessible to a general audience, including not only researchers who want to further engage with this area, but also practitioners who stand to benefit from the results, and policymakers who want to deepen their technical understanding of these important issues. Audience members should be familiar with supervised learning and have a working knowledge of gradient-based optimization techniques. Familiarity with Python and at least one deep learning framework is recommended but not required.

  title: From Statistical Relational to Neural Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
  organizers: Luc De Raedt, Sebastijan Dumancic, Robin Manhaeve and Giuseppe Marra
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The integration of learning and reasoning is one of the key challenges in artificial intelligence and machine learning today. The area neural symbolic computation tackles this challenge by integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks. This tutorial will provide an introduction to Neural Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) by drawing several parallels with another field that has a rich tradition in integrating learning and reasoning, namely Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI). The tutorial will discuss seven dimensions for introducing and categorizing several StarAI and NeSy approaches. By positioning a wide variety of systems along these dimensions, the tutorial makes it possible to underline common patterns and similarities between them. Interesting opportunities for further research will be described, by looking at areas across the dimensions that have not yet been covered. The tutorial is intended for artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners, as well as domain experts interested in the integration of symbolic reasoning and neural computation. Basic knowledge of logic and/or graphical models and/or neural computation at the level of an introductory course in AI will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Graph structured data such as social networks and molecular graphs are ubiquitous in the real world. It is of great research importance to design advanced algorithms for representation learning on graph-structured data so that downstream tasks can be facilitated. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize the deep neural network models to graph-structured data, pave a new way to effectively learn representations for graph-structured data either from the node level or the graph level. Thanks to their strong representation learning capability, GNNs have gained practical significance in various applications ranging from recommendation, natural language processing to healthcare. It has become a hot research topic and attracted increasing attention from the machine learning and data mining community recently. This tutorial of GNNs is timely for AAAI 2021 and covers relevant and interesting topics, including representation learning on graph-structured data using GNNs, self-supervised learning of GNNs, the robustness of GNNs, the scalability of GNNs, and applications based on GNNs.

  title: New Frontiers of Automated Mechanism Design for Pricing and Auctions
  organizers: Maria-Florina Balcan, Tuomas Sandholm and Ellen Vitercik
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Mechanism design is a field of game theory with significant real-world impact, encompassing areas such as pricing and auction design. Mechanisms are used in sales settings ranging from large-scale internet marketplaces to the US government's radio spectrum reallocation efforts. A powerful and prominent approach in this field is automated mechanism design, which uses optimization and machine learning to design mechanisms based on data. This automated approach helps overcome challenges faced by traditional, manual approaches to mechanism design, which have been stuck for decades due to inherent computational complexity challenges: the revenue-maximizing mechanism is not known even for just two items for sale! This workshop is focused on the rapidly growing area of automated mechanism design for revenue maximization. This encompasses both the foundations of batch and online learning (including statistical guarantees and optimization procedures), as well as real-world success stories.

  title: 'On Explainable AI: From Theory to Motivation, Industrial Applications and
    Coding Practices'
  organizers: Freddy Lecue, Pasquale Minervini, Fosca Giannotti and Riccardo Guidotti
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The future of AI lies in enabling people to collaborate with machines to solve complex problems. Like any efficient collaboration, this requires good communication, trust, clarity and understanding. XAI (eXplainable AI) aims at addressing such challenges by combining the best of symbolic AI and traditional Machine Learning. Such topic has been studied for years by all different communities of AI, with different definitions, evaluation metrics, motivations and results.
    <br />
    This tutorial is a snapshot on the work of XAI to date, and surveys the work achieved by the AI community with a focus on machine learning and symbolic AI related approaches (given the halfday format).We will motivate the needs of XAI in real-world and large-scale application, while presenting state-of-the-art techniques, with best XAI coding practices. In the first part of the tutorial, we give an introduction to the different aspects of explanations in AI. We then focus the tutorial on two specific approaches: (i) XAI using machine learning and (ii) XAI using a combination of graph-based knowledge representation and machine learning. For both we get into the specifics of the approach, the state of the art and the research challenges for the next steps. The final part of the tutorial gives an overview of real-world applications of XAI as well as best XAI coding practices.

  title: Recent Advances in Multiple Facets of Preference Learning
  organizers: Arun Rajkumar
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Analyzing preferences using pairwise/partially ordered data has a long history and has been core to several research areas including AI, statistics, operations research, game theory, social choice and theoretical computer science with a range of applications including ad-placement, voting, sports ranking, multi-criteria decision making among several others. Research in each of these areas has developed independently, typically, without a lot of interaction among them. The broad aim of this tutorial is to overview the exciting recent advances in preference learning with the aim of introducing tools and techniques across disciplines which will aid in fostering interdisciplinary AI research.
    <br />
    The target audience includes typical practitioners of AI who might have a high-level idea about preference learning but are not typically aware of the various challenging facets of the problem. The novelty of the tutorial lies in translating the different paradigms across communities into the language of AI so that it will benefit the ML/AI community. The tutorial will be self-contained and does not expect any prerequisites. Audience with basic knowledge of AI/ML would be able to follow most of the material.

  title: Simplifying and Automating Parallel Machine Learning via a Programmable and
    Composable Parallel ML System
  organizers: Hao Zhang, Aurick Qiao, Qirong Ho and Eric Xing
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    ML scale-up is frequently underestimated. What does it really take to train an ML model, originally implemented for a single CPU/GPU, on multiple machines? A few pain points are: (1) Many new lines of code need to be written to convert the code to a distributed version; (2) Need to heavily tune the code to the satisfying system/statistical performance, which is an added process to model development; (3) Decide which/how many hardware resources to use to train and deploy the model; (4) From an organization's perspective, automate resource sharing between many users and jobs to satisfy user needs while maximizing resource utilization and minimizing cost.
    <br />
    In this tutorial, we will present improved techniques to automate distributed ML infrastructure. We plan the tutorial to cover three areas critical to ML parallelization: (1) Cataloging and standardizing parallel ML building blocks; (2) Representations and software frameworks for ML parallelism; (3) Algorithms and systems to automate ML parallelization and the resource allocation of ML jobs on shared clusters. By exposing unique characteristics of ML programs, and by dissecting successful cases to reveal how they can be harnessed, we present opportunities for ML researchers and practitioners to further shape and grow the area of SysML.
    <br />
    The audience should be familiar with ML and DL basics. Knowledge of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and distributed ML techniques is also helpful but not required.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    This tutorial presents representative and state-of-the-art theories and approaches to build recommender systems (RS) and the ubiquitous applications of RS in nearly every aspect of our daily life, including eating, dressing, housing and travelling. To be specific, we will first present the background and foundations of RS, followed by the illustration of representative and advanced machine learning approaches that can be used for building RS, including latent factor models, deep learning models, graph learning models and knowledge graph models. Finally, we will demonstrate the ubiquity of RS by introducing the typical real-world applications of RS in both traditional domains, such as e-commerce, social network, and emerging domains including fashion industry, financial industry, and healthcare industry. We will conclude the tutorial by outlining future research directions in this area. No specific prerequisite knowledge is required, but a rudimentary knowledge of RS and some machine learning basic (e.g., factorization machine, deep learning) will be helpful.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Given recent advances in deep music source separation, a feature representation method is proposed that combines source separation with a state-of-the-art representation learning technique that is suitably repurposed for computer audition (i.e. machine listening). A depthwise separable convolutional neural network is trained on a challenging electronic dance music (EDM) data set and its performance is compared to convolutional neural networks operating on both source separated and standard spectrograms. It is shown that source separation improves classification performance in a limited-data setting compared to the standard single spectrogram approach.

    A significant portion of the veteran population suffers from PTSD, a mental illness that is often accompanied by social anxiety disorder. Student veterans are especially vulnerable as they struggle to adapt to a new, less structured college lifestyle. In order to assist psychologists and social workers in the treatment of social anxiety disorder we use machine learning to analyze transcribed interview text and apply topic modelling to highlight common stress factors for student veterans. The results detailed in this paper also have broader impacts in fields such as pedagogy and public health.

  organizers: Lucas G Nadolskis

  rocketchat_channel: xxx
  prerecorded: '000'
  abstract: |-
    <p>
    The project developed a device to assist blind and visually impaired
    users in complying with social distance rules. The main challenge
    was how to identify people from other objects and notify the user
    accordingly. Equally ambiguous was how to best notify the user that a
    person was violating the social distance rules.
    The hardware used is a Raspberry Pi running an image classification
    algorithm and hooked to a depth camera. The use of prediction labels and
    accuracy combined with the distance calculated by the depth camera made
    it possible to detect when a person was getting closer than 2 meters
    (6 ft) to the user.
    The device was tested both in daylight and at night, and with different
    lighting conditions. The device responded with a accuracy close to 1.9 meters, which is very acceptable.
    Testing showed that the camera is capable of identifying people coming
    from a 30 degrees angle from either side at around 1.9 meters of distance,
    giving a good range of object detection.

    Our research focuses on developing matching policies that match drivers and riders for ride-pooling services. We aim to develop policies that balance efficiency and various forms of fairness. We did this through two methods: new matching algorithms that include a fairness term in the objective function, and income redistribution methods based on the Shapley value of a driver. I tested these methods on New York City Taxicab data to evaluate their performance and found that they succeed in reducing certain forms of fairness.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    We introduce a novel technique that uses a multi-headed neural network to analyze symmetric games with a variable number of players. Many of the most impactful real-world applications of game theory, including kidney exchange, school choice, wildlife poaching prevention, and consumer protection, involve interactions with an unknown number of participants. Thus a normal-form game with a fixed number of players might be an insufficient model. Our research focuses on analyzing games with a variable number of players, where the number of participants falls in a specified range. We hypothesize that the payoffs in a game with x players are similar or related to the same game with x + 1 players, given a large value of x. With this hypothesis, we generalize prior work to analyze games with a large, variable number of players.

    <p>
    Automated deception detection systems can enhance societal well-being by helping humans detect deceivers and support people in high-stakes situations across health, social work, and legal domains. Existing computational approaches for detecting deception have not leveraged dimensional representations of affect, specifically valence and arousal, expressed during communication. My research presents a novel analysis of the potential for including affect in machine learning models for detecting deception. My work informs and motivates the development of affect-aware machine learning approaches for modeling deception and other social behaviors during human interactions in-the-wild. This research, independently defined and conducted by me, is from work-in-progress towards my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California.

    <p>
    Safety properties of neural networks are critical to their application in safety-critical domains. Quantification of their robustness against uncertainties is an upcoming area of research. In this work, we propose an approach for providing probabilistic guarantees on the performance of a trained neural network.
    We present two novel metrics for probabilistic verification on training data distribution and test dataset. Given a trained neural network, we quantify the probability of the model to make errors on a random sample drawn from the training data distribution. Second, from the output logits of a sample test point, we measure its p-value on the learned logit distribution to quantify the confidence of the model at this test point. We compare our results with softmax based metric using the black-box adversarial attacks on a simple CNN architecture trained for MNIST digit classification.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as an algorithmic method of developing neural network architectures. Weight Agnostic Neural Networks (WANNs) are an evolutionary-based NAS approach. Fundamentally, WANNs find network structures that are relatively insensitive to shifts in weight values and are typically much smaller than an equivalent performance dense network. Here, we extend the WANN framework to search for spiking circuits and in doing so investigate whether these circuit motifs can also yield task performance that is weight agnostic. We analyze properties such as the complexity of the solution, as well as performance. Our results successfully show the performance of spiking WANNs on several exemplar tasks.

    Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (Roscas) are a widely documented informal financial organization that is often used in low-income communities with limited funding sources. Roscas have been shown to serve as a tool for economic empowerment and a way of mitigating adverse shocks to income for vulnerable communities. In this paper, I describe my contributions to a  research project in which we study the allocative efficiency of different Rosca structures and formats in the presence of risk-averse agents.

  abstract: |-
    <p>
    Current applications of Agent-based Modeling (ABM) in natural phenomena like wildfire land suppression and hurricane forecasting are in monitoring emergent behavior patterns among large groups of people (Hilljegerdes 2018). However, current evacuation times and plans for natural disaster management leave underserved communities vulnerable to substantial financial and welfare losses, especially when false positives during current predictions continue to influence evacuation decisions. A Machine Learning ABM (ML-ABM) model of hurricane trajectories introduces a pioneering opportunity to capture complex physical processes associated with hurricanes while minimizing computational costs and errors, thereby providing more accurate real-time prediction of hurricanes for improved disaster management. Specifical-ly, ML-ABM leverages the strengths of conventional ma-chine learning (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs), augmenting it with the ability to model complex interactions using agent-based modeling, as has been shown useful in modeling complexities in wildfire propagation and suppression (Hu and Sun 2007). This Hurricane Track Prediction ML-ABM model aims to quickly model and predict hurricane tracks in only a few minutes while retaining some of the complex physical process interactions of real storms through feature engineering and deep learning. This work focuses on the implementation of an RNN with bidirectional time-distributed Long-Short Term Memory cells (Usmani 2018), accounting for positive and negative time direction in time series forecasting. The observations and predictions were represented as a multi-agent system in NetLogo for further emergent pattern analysis in expanded research by Ar-thur Drake et. al (2020). The model also evaluates benchmark comparisons against the National Hurricane Center’s 5-Year Average Forecast Errors and the BCD5 Error Model, a combined intensity and track prediction error model that utilizes best track input and models de-cay over land.

    My research presents a method for efficient exploration of an outdoor, unknown area, which aims to achieve precise coverage of regions of interest within that area. While this method for autonomous exploration was designed for autonomous controllers in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the concepts apply to any vehicle which uses autonomous navigation. We consider an environment with areas of interest of various sizes littered throughout, and a reinforcement learning agent which is tasked with discovering and mapping these areas in an efficient manner.

    <p>
    Illegal wildlife poaching is driving the loss of biodiversity. To combat poaching, rangers patrol expansive protected areas for illegal poaching activity. However, rangers often cannot comprehensively search such large parks. Thus, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) uses machine learning to help identify the areas with highest poaching risk. As PAWS is deployed to parks around the world, we recognized that many parks have limited resources for data collection and therefore have scarce feature sets. To ensure under-resourced parks have access to meaningful poaching predictions, we introduce the use of publicly available remote sensing data to extract features for parks. By employing this data from Google Earth Engine, we also incorporate previously unavailable dynamic data such as climate and primary production patterns to enrich predictions with seasonal trends. We automate the entire data-to-deployment pipeline and find that, with only using publicly available data, we recuperate prediction performance comparable to predictions made using features manually computed by park specialists. We conclude that the inclusion of satellite imagery creates for a robust system through which parks of any resource level can benefit from poaching risks for years to come.
