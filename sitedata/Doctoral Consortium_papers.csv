DC-79,AI for Social Good: Between My Research and the Real World,Zheyuan Ryan Shi,"AI for social good (AI4SG) is a research theme that aims to use and advance AI to improve the well-being of society. My work on AI4SG builds a two-way bridge between the research world and the real world. Using my unique experience in food waste and security, I propose applied AI4SG research that directly addresses real-world challenges which have received little attention from the community. Drawing from my experience in various AI4SG application domains, I propose bandit data-driven optimization, the first iterative prediction-prescription framework and a no-regret algorithm PROOF. I will apply PROOF back to my applied work on AI4SG, thereby closing the loop in a single framework.","i.e., a link to the preprint version of each paper (probably hosted in AAAI official site). We also need a zipped file of all the papers in order to extract an image from each paper","e.g., 10:00-11:00, February 7 ","i.e., for the link https://slideslive.com/paper.SlidesLivePresentationID",Each paper has a unique GatherTownLink,We need this information if there is a paper presentation session
DC-118,Effective Clustering of scRNA-seq Data to Identify Biomarkers without User Input,Hussain Chowdhury,"Clustering unleashes the power of scRNA-seq through identification of appropriate cell groups. It is considered a pre-requisite to performing differential expression analysis, followed by functional profiling to identify potential biomarkers from scRNA-seq data. Most existing clustering methods either integrate cluster validity indices or need user assistance to identify clusters of arbitrary shape. We develop two clustering methods 1) UIFDBC to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes, 2) UIPBC to cluster scRNA-seq data. Neither method integrates a cluster validity index nor takes any user input. Both approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,
DC-127,Verification and Repair of Neural Networks,Dario Guidotti,In this work I present an overview of my current research activities. My work lies at the intersection between Formal Verification and Neural Networks.,,,,,
DC-169,"Towards Fair, Equitable, and Efficient Peer Review",Ivan Stelmakh,"My work focuses on issues of bias and unfairness in an important application that forms the backbone of all of science -- refereeing of manuscripts, also known as peer review. Despite peer review being the primary mechanism of science dissemination for decades, the rapid growth of the number of submissions to leading AI and ML conferences has challenged its sustainability in two ways: (i) It has brought up a call for automated tools to assist human decision-makers and (ii) It has amplified the shortcomings of the peer-review procedure, making them more visible to the community and stressing the importance of research on peer review. These issues motivate my thesis research and I am passionate about working at the intersection of machine learning, operations research, social choice theory, and human-computer interaction, to understand and develop a principled approach towards scientific peer review. Specifically, I believe that a carefully designed Human-AI collaboration is crucial for sustainability of peer review and in my work I aim at designing tools to support this collaboration.",,,,,
DC-200,Creating Interpretable Data-Driven Approaches for Remote Health Monitoring,Alireza Ghods,"We are at a turning point to address the unprecedented challenges we are facing in healthcare systems. With the aging of the population and increasing health disparities  in rural areas, healthcare needs assistance from technologies to address the needs of these populations. Inexpensive sensors embedded in everyday physical settings and ubiquitous wearable devices might provide such a solution. In close collaboration with clinicians, we hope to expose the true potential of data-driven approaches to healthcare. My doctoral research goal is to introduce novel ways to help clinicians understand patients' health status by developing new visualization tools and interpretable models that analyze human health and behavior from sensor data.",,,,,
DC-246,Distributed Situation Awareness for Multi-agent Mission in Dynamic En-vironments: A Case Study of Multi-UAVs Wildfires Searching,Sagir Muhammad Yusuf|Chris Baber,"This thesis focuses attention on achieving distributed situation awareness (DSA) with minimal resources involving the use of low capacited agents (e.g., UAVs) coordinated in decentralised fashion. This is incontrast to the existing works involving complex and sophisticated communication and algorithms. We hope to achieve also an effective path planning strategy for the agents conducting space exploration task (i.e., our use case). Probabilistic reasoning, learning, and predictable agents' path planning strategy will be used in achieving our aim. The path planning strategy will utilises policies from computational geometry. Results from the outlined mythologies shows fruitful outcome in event predictions and resources agents utilisations.",,,,,
DC-260,Effect of Alterations on Face Recognition Algorithms,Puspita Majumdar,"Modern deep learning systems have achieved unparalleled success and several applications have significantly benefited due to these technological advancements. However, these systems have also shown different vulnerabilities that have strong implications on the performance of such systems. Among these vulnerabilities, alterations have been Achilles’ heel problem. Applications such as face recognition are susceptible to alterations due to changes in facial features and real-world image distortions. In the presence of alterations, we have observed that system predictions become biased towards particular demographic subgroups along with overall performance degradation. My research focuses on analyzing the effect of alterations on automatic face recognition systems and developing algorithms to overcome the effects of alteration for fair and robust face recognition.",,,,,
DC-276,A Computational Approach to Sign Language Understanding,Tejaswini Ananthanarayana,"Sign language is the primary mode of communication in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) communities. Unfortunately, sign language is not as well understood among the non-signing hearing population leading to limited access and services to the DHH community, and also acts as a barrier between non-signing and DHH people. In my Ph.D. thesis, I am working on improving the sequence modeling for sign language translation and understanding by considering different types of sequence models, various input features, and by understanding the semantic relation between the words and the signs. Currently, my research focuses on a popular publicly available German Sign Language dataset.",,,,,
DC-281,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning forautonomous agents that learn to plan and operatein unpredictable dynamic environments,Leonardo Lamanna,"My  research  activity  focuses  on  the  integration  of  acting, learning and planning. The main objective is to build a system that is capable to learn how to plan and act in an unknown, dynamic and complex environment. On the learning side, I’m interested in developing algorithms that allow an artificial agent to learn an abstract model of the dynamics of the environment (e.g. an explicit model like a deterministic finite state machine or a model described in a language to express planning domains). In addition to learning the abstract model, I’m interested in learning probabilistic (generative) models that connects the abstract model with the perceptions of the artificial agents. On the acting and planning side, the artificial agent decides how to act by means of state-of-art planners, e.g. Fastdownward (Helmert 2006). With its own experience, it enriches the planner knowledge, as well as the learned model of the environment. On the learning part, the agent applies techniques for dynamic probabilistic clustering of perceptions in a set of abstract states, neural network for learning transition models, and inductive reasoning for learning action model descriptions.",,,,,
DC-304,How Human Centered AI Will Contribute Towards Intelligent Gaming Systems,Yilei Zeng,"A paradigm shift towards human-centered intelligent gaming systems is gradually setting in. Such intelligent gaming system with embedded machine learning algorithms would explain player motivations, help design more personalized single player and collaborative experiences, transfer and generalize the learning from game to game. The multi-modal user behavior trajectories, both in-game and across various platforms, incorporate heterogeneous information and graph structures. These gaming modalities range from text, audios, video demos, activity replays, and social networks to psychological questionnaires. Identifying decision making patterns and strategies not only by observing in-game behavior actions but also by mining heterogeneous sources could construct a more holistic representation of the gaming community. Human priors publicly available on the World Wide Web would inspire the modeling for human-like non-player characters, adaptive recommendation systems, automatic game design, testing, and human-AI collaborations. My doctoral research goal is to mine, represent, and learn from human priors existing in the interactive entertainment community's heterogeneous sources and introduce ways to model single and multi-agent interactive behavior patterns.",,,,,
DC-311,Perception Beyond Sensors Under Uncertainty,Masha Itkina,"To achieve safe and comfortable driving, autonomous vehicles must have the capability to effectively model and make inferences from observed human behaviors on the road. This functionality is termed autonomous perception. Due to the high variability and stochasticity within human behaviors, the associated uncertainty should be incorporated into the perception module. The proposed thesis presents learning-based approaches to the perception tasks of behavior prediction and occlusion inference, while explicitly considering aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.",,,,,
DC-314,Robots that Help Humans Build Better Mental Models of Robots,Preeti Ramaraj,"Interactive Task Learning (ITL) is a research approach to build robots that can learn new tasks through language and demonstration. It relies on the fact that people have experience teaching each other. However, this can be challenging if the human instructor does not have an accurate mental model of a robot. Creating, maintaining, and improving one’s mental model of the robot requires that the robot can use natural interaction patterns that humans engage in. The research question that I am investigating is “How can the robot help the human build a bettermental model of the robot?”",,,,,
DC-317,Constraint-Driven Learning of Logic Programs,Rolf Morel,"Two fundamental challenges in program synthesis, i.e.~learning programs from specifications, are (1) program correctness and (2) search efficiency. We claim logical constraints can address both: (1) by expressing stronger requirements on solutions and (2) due to being effective at eliminating non-solutions. We use logical methods to derive classes of programs which can be eliminated. These classes we encode into constraints. When learning from examples, a logic program failing on an example means that (a class of) related programs fail as well. We are expanding this reasoning with failure explanation: identifying responsible sub-programs for which more related programs can be eliminated. In addition to reasoning about examples, programming involves ensuring general properties are not violated. Inspired by the synthesis of functional programs, we intend to encode correctness properties as well as runtime complexity bounds into constraints.",,,,,
DC-318,Screening for Depressed Individuals by Using Multimodal Social Media Data,Paulo Mann|Aline Paes|Elton Matsushima,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has increased at alarming rates in the worldwide population. Despite this, many individuals are not identified as presenting depression symptoms due to the absence of proper clinical care. One alternative to finding them is to use social media data to train machine learning (ML) models that can identify depressed cases automatically. Moreover, with ML one can also find patterns regarding depression and social media usage. Previous works have already relied on ML to solve the task of screening depressed individuals with reasonably good precision and recall scores. Still, several limitations prevent the full potential of these models. In this work, we show that the depression identification task through social media is better modeled as a Multiple Instance Learning problem. Further, social media data is frequently multimodal where texts and images may jointly be used to learn intricate patterns. Finally, we argue that by modeling temporal dependencies between posts, be it hierarchical, sequential, or both, helps with model explainability and representation power. We also show that our proposed techniques to overcome these limitations can be generalized to other problems.",,,,,
DC-340,Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Coalition Formation Games,Kshitija Taywade,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) are prevalent in the real-world in a variety of domains. In many multi-agent systems, interaction among agents is inevitable and co-operation in some form is needed among agents for dealing with the task at hand. We consider the type of multi-agent systems where autonomous agents inhabit an environment with no global control or global knowledge, decentralized in true sense. In particular, we are interested in coalition formation problems and their variants such as hedonic coalition formation games (also called as hedonic games), matching (a common type of hedonic game), and coalition formation for task allocation. We propose novel decentralized learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches to train agents in learning behaviors and adapting to the environments, and we use game-theoretic evaluation criteria such as optimality, stability, and indexes like Shapley value.",,,,,
DC-415,Engagement Assessment for Robot-Assisted Therapy Adaptation for Children with ASD,Nazerke Rakhymbayeva,"Several projects around the world are developing to treat and diagnose autistic children by utilizing robots. This work is aimed to design an autonomous child-centered robot-enhanced treatment for nonverbal children diagnosed with a severe form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) combined with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The state-of-the-art research includes exploring transfer learning on existing Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) datasets to evaluate classification algorithms for engagement recognition. The underlying assumption states the secondary datasets are directly or indirectly linked to the primary dataset through the common features. The research project has the potential to improve existing approaches for autism by offering more efficient monitoring and evaluation of the therapy progress by using multi-modal datasets that consists of facial expressions, head pose, vocal and physiological cues.",,,,,
DC-423,Relational Learning to Capture the Dynamics and Sparsity of Knowledge Graphs,Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri,"The rapid growth of large scale event datasets with timestamps has given rise to the dynamically evolving multi-relational knowledge graphs. Reasoning over time on such data brings on many challenges and is still not well understood. Most real-world knowledge graphs are characterized by a long-tail relation frequency distribution where a significant fraction  of relations occurs only a handful of times. This observation has given rise to recent interest in low-shot learning methods that are able to generalize from only a few examples. The existing approaches, however, are tailored to static knowledge graphs and not easily generalized to temporal settings, where data scarcity poses even bigger problems, due to occurrence of new, previously unseen relations. The goal of my doctoral research is to introduce new approaches for learning meaningful representation that capture the dynamics of temporal knowledge graphs while tackling numerous existing challenges such as data scarcity.",,,,,
DC-429,Safety Assurance for Systems with Machine Learning Components,Chelsea Sidrane,"Deep learning has proven to be a useful tool in domains as diverse as computer vision, natural language processing, and control of autonomous agents. Given its success, there is interest in applying deep learning to safety-critical systems. This creates a need to assure the safety of trained neural networks and systems containing neural network components. My thesis focuses on addressing this need through study and development ofheuristic safety thresholds, formal verification of safety properties, and the use of testing strategies to find failures, all for systems containing deep learning components.",,,,,
