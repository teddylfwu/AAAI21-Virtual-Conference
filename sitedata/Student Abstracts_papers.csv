SA-11,Towards Sample Efficient Agents through Algorithmic Alignment,Mingxuan Li|Michael Littman,"Deep reinforcement-learning agents have demonstrated great success on various tasks. However, current methods typically suffer from sample complexity problem when learning in high dimensional observation spaces, which limits the application of deep reinforcement-learning agents to complex, uncertain real world tasks. In this work, we propose and explore Deep Graph Value Network as a promising method to work around this drawback using a message-passing mechanism. The main idea is that the RL agent should be guided by structured non-neural-network algorithms like dynamic programming. According to recent advances in algorithmic alignment, neural networks with structured computation procedures can be trained efficiently. We demonstrate the potential of graph neural network in supporting sample efficient learning by showing that Deep Graph Value Network can outperform unstructured baselines by a large margin with low sample complexity.","i.e., a link to the preprint version of each paper (probably hosted in AAAI official site).

SA-69,Multi-label Few-shot Learning with Semantic Inference,Zhen Wang|Yiqun Duan|Liu Liu|Dacheng Tao,"Few-shot learning can adapt the classification model to new labels with only a few labeled examples. Previous studies mainly focus on the scenario of a single category label per example but have not solved the more challenging multi-label scenario with exponential-sized output space and low-data effectively. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware meta-learning model for multi-label few-shot learning. Our approach can learn and infer the semantic correlation between unseen labels and historical labels to quickly adapt multi-label tasks from only a few examples. Specifically, features can be mapped into the semantic embedding space via label word vectors to explore and exploit the label correlation, and thus cope with the challenge on the overwhelming size of the output space. Then a novel semantic inference mechanism is designed for leveraging prior knowledge learned from historical labels, which will produce good generalization performance on new labels to alleviate the low-data problem. Finally, extensive empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on the multi-label few-shot learning tasks.",,,,,
SA-117,Source Separation and Depthwise Separable Convolutions for Computer Audition,Gabriel Mersy|Jin Hong Kuan,"Given the recent advances in deep audio source separation, we propose a feature representation method that combines music source separation with a state-of-the-art representation learning technique that is suitably repurposed for computer audition (i.e. machine listening). We train a depthwise separable convolutional neural network on a challenging electronic dance music (EDM) data set and show that the method requires few training samples and achieves significantly better classification performance compared to baseline at a reduced training time.",,,,,
SA-129,Logic Guided Genetic Algorithms,Dhananjay Ashok|Joseph Scott|Sebastian Wetzel|Maysum Panju|Vijay Ganesh,"We present a novel Auxiliary Truth enhanced Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses logical or mathematical constraints as a means of data augmentation as well as to compute loss (in conjunction with the traditional MSE), with the aim of increasing both data efficiency and accuracy of symbolic regression (SR) algorithms. Our method, logic-guided genetic algorithm (LGGA), takes as input a set of labelled data points and auxiliary truths (AT) (mathematical facts known a priori about the unknown function the regressor aims to learn) and outputs a specially generated and curated dataset that can be used with any SR method. We evaluate LGGA against state-of-the-art SR tools, namely, Eureqa and TuringBot and find that using these SR tools in conjunction with LGGA results in them solving up to 30% more equations, needing only a fraction of the amount of data compared to the same tool without LGGA, i.e., resulting in up to a 61.9% improvement in data efficiency.",,,,,

Experiments on public Reddit dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.",,,,,
SA-140,"Robotic Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning, State Representation Learning, and Imitation Learning",Hanxiao Chen,"Humans possess the advanced ability to grab, hold, and manipulate objects with dexterous hands. What about robots? Can they interact with the surrounding world environment intelligently to achieve certain goals (e.g. grasping, button-pushing), even finish complicated tasks like human hands? Actually, robotic manipulation is central to achieving the premise of robotics and represents immense potentials to be widely applied in various practical scenarios like industries and homes. In this work, we aim to address multiple robotic manipulation tasks like grasping, button-pushing, and door-opening with reinforcement learning (RL), state representation learning (SRL), and imitation learning. For diverse missions, we self-built the PyBullet or MuJoCo simulated environments and independently explored three different learning-style methods to successfully solve such tasks: (1) Normal reinforcement learning approaches; (2) Combined state representation learning (SRL) and RL methods; (3) Imitation learning bootstrapped RL algorithms.",,,,,

This work studies this problem by combining deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning with drivers’ intentions prediction.

We show that this solution improves security performances.",,,,,
SA-143,Scalable Partial Explainability in Neural Networks via Flexible Activation Functions,Schyler C. Sun|Chen Li|Zhuangkun Wei|Antonios Tsourdos|Weisi Guo,"Current state-of-the-art neural network explanation methods (e.g. Saliency maps, DeepLIFT, LIME, etc.) focus more on the direct relationship between NN outputs and inputs rather than the NN structure and operations itself, hence there still exists uncertainty over the exact role played by neurons. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network structure with Kolmogorov-Arnold Superposition Theorem based topology and Gaussian Processes based flexible activation function to achieve partial explainability of the neuron inner reasoning. The model feasibility is verified in a case study on binary classification of the banknotes.",,,,,
SA-144,Melodic Phrase Attention Network for Symbolic Data-based Music Genre Classification,Li Li|Rui Zhang|Zhenyu Wang,"Compare with audio data-based music genre classification, researches on symbolic data-based music are scarce. Existing methods generally utilize manually extracted features, which is very time-consuming and laborious, and use traditional classifiers for label prediction without considering specific music features. To tackle this issue, we propose the Melodic Phrase Attention Network (MPAN) for symbolic data-based music genre classification. Our model is trained in three steps: First, we adopt representation learning, instead of the traditional musical feature extraction method, to obtain a vectorized representation of the music pieces. Second, the music pieces are divided into several melodic phrases through melody segmentation. Finally, the Melodic Phrase Attention Network is designed according to music characteristics, to identify the reflection of each melodic phrase on the music genre, thereby generating more accurate predictions. Experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to baseline symbolic data-based music genre classification approaches, and has achieved significant performance improvements on two large datasets.",,,,,
SA-148,Semi-Discrete Social Recommendation,Fangyuan Luo|Jun Wu|Haishuai Wang,"Combining matrix factorization (MF) with network embedding (NE) has been a promising solution to social recommender systems. However, such a scheme suffers from the prediction efficiency issue due to the ever-growing users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing-based social recommendation model, called semi-discrete socially embedded matrix factorization (S2MF), which leverages the dual advantages of social information for recommendation effectiveness and hashing trick for online predictive efficiency. Specifically, S2MF jointly optimizes the combined objective of MF model and NE model partially under the discrete constraints, in order that the discrete preference learning and continuous social embedding tasks can be reinforced each other in a unified optimization framework. Furthermore, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to estimate the model parameters by alternatively solving a series of mixed-integer programming subproblems. Experimental results on three real-world benchmarks show that S2MF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discrete recommendation models, and consumes much less computational cost than its real-valued competitor at the expense of a little loss in recommendation accuracy.",,,,,
SA-149,Generating Adversarial yet Inconspicuous Patches with a Single Image,Jinqi Luo|Tao Bai|Jun Zhao,"Deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial patches, where exotic patterns can result in model’s wrong prediction. Nevertheless, existing approaches to adversarial patch generation hardly consider the contextual consistency between patches and the image background, causing such patches to be easily detected and adversarial attacks to fail. Additionally, these methods require a large amount of data for training, which is computationally expensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach to generate adversarial yet inconspicuous patches with one single image. In our approach, adversarial patches are produced in a coarse-to-fine way with multiple scales of generators and discriminators. The selection of patch location is based on the perceptual sensitivity of victim models. Contextual information is encoded during the Min-Max training to make patches consistent with surroundings.",,,,,
SA-156,Towards Extracting Graph Neural Network Models via Prediction Queries,Bang Wu|Shirui Pan|Xingliang Yuan,"Graph data has been widely used to represent data from various domain, e.g., social networks, recommendation system. With great power, the GNN models, usually as valuable properties of their owners, also become attractive targets of the adversary who covets to steal them. While existing works show that simple deep neural networks can be reproduced by so-called Model Extraction Attacks, how to extract a GNN model has not been explored. In this paper, we exploit the threat of model extraction attacks against GNN models. Unlike ordinary attacks which obtain model information via only the input-output query pairs, we utilize both the node queries and the graph structure to extract the GNNs. Furthermore, we consider the stealthiness of the attack and propose to generate legitimate queries so the extraction can be applied discreetly. We implement our attack by leveraging the responses of these queries, as well as other accessible knowledge, e.g., neighbor connectives of the queried nodes. By evaluating over three real-world datasets, our attack is shown to effectively produce a surrogate model with more than 80% equivalent predictions as the target model.",,,,,
SA-161,Improving Aerial Instance Segmentation in the Dark with Self-Supervised Low Light Enhancement,Prateek Garg|Murari Mandal|Pratik Narang,"Low light conditions in aerial images adversely affect the performance of several vision based applications. There is a need for methods that can efficiently remove the low light attributes and assist in the performance of key vision tasks. In this work, we propose a new method that is capable of enhancing the low light image in a self supervised fashion, and sequentially apply detection and segmentation tasks in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method occupies a very small overhead in terms of memory and computational power over the original algorithm and delivers superior results. Additionally, we propose the generation of a new low light aerial dataset using GANs, which can be used to evaluate vision based networks for similar adverse conditions.",,,,,

Then, we design a Learning Network in the appearance domain that recognizes the scene according to local captions.

SA-167,Preventing Overfitting via Sample Reweighting for Recommender System Incremental Update,Danni Peng|Xiaobo Hu|Anxiang Zeng|Jie Zhang,"Incremental update of recommender system models using only newly arrived data may easily cause the model to overfit to the current data.

SA-168,Reducing Neural Network Parameter Initialization Into an SMT Problem,Mohamad Hosein Danesh,"Training a neural network (NN) depends on multiple factors, including but not limited to the initial weights. In this paper, we focus on initializing deep NN parameters such that it performs better, comparing to random or zero initialization. We do this by reducing the process of initialization into an SMT solver. Previous works consider certain activation functions on small NNs, however the studied NN is a deep network with different activation functions. Our experiments show that the proposed approach for parameter initialization achieves better performance comparing to randomly initialized networks.",,,,,
SA-171,WildfireNet: Predicting Wildfire Profiles,Samuel Sung|Yuping Li|Leonard Ortolano,"Forecasting accurate wildfire profile is an essential tool for firefighters when planning an evacuation strategy. Therefore, we propose a WildfireNet that can predict the shape of the wildfire of the next day, when given historical wildfire profiles, elevation, and weather data. The motivation behind WildfireNet is to locate fires in a precise manner and be able to accurately predict upcoming fires. The model’s architecture was built in the inspiration of U-Net, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) commonly used in a biomedical image segmentation. Intersection over Union (IoU) and recall were calculated to measure the performance of the model. The model achieved an IoU score of 0.997 in the test set. Since, the objective of the model is to predict upcoming fires, pixels that were labeled as fire but not on the previous days were extracted to calculate recall. In the test set, WildfireNet scored a recall around 0.75 for fires that grew slowly. Overall, WildfireNet is a novel wildfire spread model and has the potential to be a tool to aid firefighters in their decision making.",,,,,

SA-186,Rotation-Invariant Gait Identification with Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks,Bowen Jing|Vinay Prabhu|Angela Gu|John Whaley,"Accelerometric gait identification systems should ideally be robust to changes in device orientation from the enrollment phase to the deployment phase. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in these systems compensate poorly for such distributional shifts. In this paper, we target this problem by introducing an SO(3)-equivariant quaternion convolutional kernel inside the CNN. Our architecture (Quaternion CNN) significantly outperforms a traditional CNN in a multi-user gait classification setting. Additionally, the kernels learned by QCNN can be visualized as basis-independent trajectory fragments in Euclidean space, a novel mode of feature visualization and extraction.",,,,,
SA-187,Deep Reinforcement Learning for a Dictionary Based Compression Schema,Keren Nivasch|Dana Shapira|Amos Azaria,"An increasingly important process of the internet age and the massive data era is file compression. One popular compression scheme, LZW, maintains a dictionary of previously seen strings. The dictionary is updated throughout the parsing process by adding new encountered substrings. Klein, Opalinsky and Shapira (2019) recently studied the option of selectively updating the LZW dictionary. They show that even inserting only a random subset of the strings into the dictionary does not adversely affect the compression ratio.Inspired by their approach, we propose a reinforcement learning based agent, RLZW, that decides when to add a string to the dictionary. The agent is first trained on a large set of data, and then tested on files it has not seen previously (i.e., the test set). We show that on some types of input data, RLZW outperforms the compression ratio of a standard LZW.",,,,,
SA-188,Improving the Performance-Compatibility Tradeoff with Personalized Objective Functions,Jonathan Martinez,"AI-systems that model and interact with their users can update their models over time to reflect new information and changes in the environment. Although these updates may improve the overall performance of the AI-system, they may actually hurt the performance with respect to individual users. Prior work has studied the tradeoff between improving the system's performance following an update and the compatibility of the updated system with prior user experience. The more the model is forced to be compatible with a prior version, the higher loss in performance it will incur. This paper shows that that by personalizing the loss function to specific users, it is possible to increase the prediction performance of the AI-system while sacrificing less compatibility for these users following an update to improve the system's performance. Our approach updates the  sample weights  to reflect their contribution to the compatibility of the model for a particular user following the update. We construct a portfolio of different models that vary in how they personalize the loss function for a target user and then select  the  best model to use based on a validation set. We use a model selection algorithm to choose the best model from the portfolio for each user given a set of features that reflect the users' characteristics and performance of the different models on a training set. We apply this approach to three supervised learning tasks commonly used in the human-computer decision-making literature. We show that using our approach leads to     significant improvements in the performance-compatibility tradeoff  over the  non-personalized approach of Bansal et al., achieving up to 300% improvement for certain users.",,,,,

As a result, a much better approximation of top-k and lower computational cost is achieved compared to the previous approach.",,,,,
SA-193,Role of Optimizer on Network Fine-tuning for Adversarial Robustness,Akshay Agarwal|Mayank Vatsa|Richa Singh,"The massive deployment of convolutional neural networks across various applications, including security-related fields such as person identification, autonomous driving, and healthcare, makes it crucial to increase their robustness against adversarial perturbations. In literature, most of the solutions provided for adversarial robustness either fail against the challenging gradient-based attacks or are computationally demanding, such as adversarial training. However, the adversarial training or network training based data augmentation shows the potential to increase the adversarial robustness. While the training seems compelling, it is not feasible for resource-constrained institutions, especially academia, to train the network from scratch multiple times. In this research, we provide an effective solution against adversarial attacks through a few network fine-tuning steps. While performing the fine-tuning, the optimizer role is observed by keeping it the same and different from the optimizer used in the network's pre-training. Extensive experiments using a wide range of databases, including Fashion-MNIST and a subset of ImageNet, are performed. Through the experiments, it is found that the few steps of network fine-tuning effectively increase the robustness of both shallow and deep architectures. To know other interesting observations, especially regarding the role of the optimizer, refer to the full paper.",,,,,
SA-197,Domain Generalisation with Domain Augmented Supervised Contrastive Learning,Hoang Son Le|Rini Akmeliawati|Gustavo Carneiro,"Domain generalisation represents the challenging problem of using multiple training domains to learn a model that can generalise to unseen targets. Recent papers have proposed using data augmentation to produce realistic adversarial examples to simulate domain shift. Under current domain adaptation/generalisation theory, it is unclear whether training with data augmentation alone is sufficient to improve domain generalisation results. We propose an extension of the current theoretical framework with a new method that combines data augmentation and domain distance minimisation to reduce the upper bound on domain generalisation error. Empirically, our algorithm produces competitive results when compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the domain generalisation benchmark PACS. We have also performed an extensive ablation study of the technique on a chest x-ray dataset, consisting of a subset of CheXpert, Chest14, and PadChest datasets.",,,,,

SA-206,RL Generalization in a Theory of Mind Game Through a Sleep Metaphor (Student Abstract),Tyler Malloy|Tim Klinger|Miao Liu|Gerald Tesauro|Matt Riemer|Chris Sims,"Training agents to learn efficiently in multi-agent environments can benefit from the explicit modelling of other agent's beliefs, especially in complex limited-information games such as the Hanabi card game. However, generalization is also highly relevant to performance in these games, though model comparisons at large training timescales can be difficult. In this work, we address this by introducing a novel model trained using a sleep metaphor on a reduced complexity version of the Hanabi game. This sleep metaphor consists an altered training regiment, as well as an information-theoretic constraint on the agent's policy. Results from experimentation demonstrate improved performance through this sleep-metaphor method, and provide a promising motivation for using similar techniques in more complex methods that incorporate explicit models of other agent's beliefs.",,,,,
SA-207,Improving Label Noise Robustness with Data Augmentation and Semi-Supervised Learning,Kento Nishi|Yi Ding|Alex Rich|Tobias Höllerer,"Modern machine learning algorithms typically require large amounts of labeled training data to fit a reliable model. To minimize the cost of data collection, researchers often employ techniques such as crowdsourcing and web scraping. However, web data and human annotations are known to exhibit high margins of error, resulting in sizable amounts of incorrect labels. Poorly labeled training data can cause models to overfit to the noise distribution, crippling performance in real-world applications. In this work, we investigate the viability of using data augmentation in conjunction with semi-supervised learning to improve the label noise robustness of image classification models. We conduct several experiments using noisy variants of the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset to benchmark our algorithm against existing methods. Experimental results show that our augmentative SSL approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.",,,,,

SA-213,Contextual Bandits with Delayed Feedback and Semi-supervised Learning,Luting Yang|Jianyi Yang|Shaolei Ren,"In this paper, we address delayed feedback in contextual bandits by using semi-supervised learning — incorporate estimates of delayed rewards to improve the estimation of future rewards. Concretely, the reward feedback for an arm selected at the beginning of a round is only observed by the agent/learner with some observation noise and provided to the agent after some a priori unknown but bounded delays. Motivated by semi-supervised learning that produces pseudo labels for unlabeled data to further improve the model performance, we generate fictitious estimates of rewards that are delayed and have yet to arrive based on already-learnt reward functions. Thus, by combining semi-supervised learning with online contextual bandit learning, we propose a novel extension and design two algorithms, which estimate the values for currently unavailable reward feedbacks to minimize the maximum estimation error and average estimation error, respectively.",,,,,

SA-223,Encoding Temporal and Spatial Vessel Context using Self-Supervised Learning Model,Pierre Bernabé|Helge Spieker|Bruno Legeard|Arnaud Gotlieb,"Maritime surveillance is essential to avoid illegal activities and for environmental protection. However, the unlabeled, noisy, irregular time-series data and the large area to be covered make it challenging to detect illegal activities. Existing solutions focus only on trajectory reconstruction and probabilistic models that do ignore the context, such as the neighboring vessels. We propose a novel representation learning method that considers both temporal and spatial contexts learned in a self-supervised manner, using a selection of pretext tasks that do not require to be labeled manually. The underlying model encodes the representation of maritime vessel data compactly and effectively. This generic encoder can then be used as inputs for more complex tasks lacking labeled data.",,,,,

Learning low-dimensional embeddings of graph data in certain curved Riemannian manifolds has recently gained traction, due to their desirable property of acting as effective geometrical inductive biases. More specifically, models of Hyperbolic geometry such as Poincar\'{e} Ball and Lorentz/Hyperboloid Model have found extensive applications for learning discrete data such as Graphs and Trees with hierarchical anatomy. The measure of how best a given graph data can be embedded in hyperbolic geometry is described by a property called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, that shows the Tree-likeliness of given data. In this paper, we show that adversarial attacks which perturb the network structure also affect the hyperbolicity of graphs rendering hyperbolic geometry ineffective for learning low-dimensional node embeddings of graph data. To circumvent this problem, we introduce learning embeddings in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds such as Lorentzian manifolds and show empirically that they are robust to adversarial perturbations. Despite recent proliferation of adversarial robustness methods in context of graph data, this is the first work that explores the relationship between adversarial attacks and the property of hyperbolicity, while also providing resolution to navigate such vulnerabilities.",,,,,
SA-263,Knowledge-aware Dialogue Generation with Hybrid Attention,Yaru Zhao|Bo Cheng|Yingying Zhang,"Using commonsense knowledge to assist dialogue generation is a big step forward for dialogue generation task. However, how to fully utilize commonsense information is always a challenge. Furthermore, the entities generated in the response do not match the information in the post most often. In this paper, we propose a dialogue generation model which uses hybrid attention to better generate rational entities. When a user post is given, the model encodes relevant knowledge graphs from a knowledge base with a graph attention mechanism. Then it will encode the user post and graphs with a co-attention mechanism, which effectively encodes complex related data. Through the above mechanism, we can get a better mutual understanding of post and knowledge. The experimental results show that our model is more effective than the current state-of-the-art model (CCM).",,,,,
SA-267,Remember More by Recalling Less: Investigating the Role of Batch Size in Continual Learning with Experience Replay,Maciej Wołczyk|Andrii Krutsylo,"Experience replay is a simple and well-performing strategy for continual learning problems, often used as a basis for more advanced methods. However, the dynamics of experience replay are not yet well understood. To showcase this, we focus on a single component of this problem, namely choosing the batch size of the buffer samples. We find that small batches perform much better at stopping forgetting than larger batches, contrary to the intuitive assumption that it is better to recall more samples from the past to avoid forgetting. We show that this phenomenon does not disappear under learning rate tuning and we propose possible directions for further analysis.",,,,,
SA-273,A Nested Named Entity Recognition Model Based on Multi-agent Communication Mechanism,Canguang Li|Guohua Wang|Jin Cao|Yi Cai,"Traditional sequence tagging methods for named entity recognition (NER) face challenges when handling nested entities, where an entity is nested in another. Most previous methods for nested NER ignore the effect of entity boundary information or type information. Considering that entity boundary information and type information can be utilized to improve the performance of boundary detection, we propose a nested NER model with a multi-agent communication module. The type tagger and boundary tagger in the multi-agent communication module iteratively utilize the information from each other, which improves the boundary detection and the final performance of nested NER. Empirical experiments conducted on two nested NER datasets show the effectiveness of our model.",,,,,
SA-274,A Quantum-inspired Complex-valued Representation for Encoding Sentiment Information,Guangcheng Liu|Yuexian Hou|Shikai Song,"Recently, a Quantum Probability Drive Network (QPDN) is proposed to model different levels of semantic units by extending word embedding to complex-valued representation (CR). The extended complex-valued embeddings are still insensitive to polarity causing that they generalize badly in sentiment analysis (SA). To solve it, we propose a method of encoding sentiment information into sentiment  words for SA. Attention mechanism and an auxiliary task are introduced to help learn the CR of sentiment words with the help of the sentiment lexicon. We use the amplitude part to represent the distributional information and the phase part to represent the sentiment information of the language. Experiments on three popular SA datasets show that our method is effective.",,,,,
SA-277,Is active learning always beneficial?,Anna Kravchenko|Rhodri Cusack,"In some cases a network is best trained for a task by following a curriculum, in which simpler concepts are learned before more complex ones. This curriculum could be handcrafted by the engineer or optimised like other hyperparameters. However, an attractive alternative is that the network by monitoring its learning, could choose its own curriculum. In machine learning, this is called automated curriculum learning; in human learning and developmental robotics it is active or curiosity-driven learning. Metrics, including the performance on the current task, the gradient of learning, and information theory measures, have been used to help the learner to determine when to switch between task stages. Active learning is appealing, as it makes design simpler and could allow networks to adapt to new datasets, but is it always possible? In human learning, formal education with a fixed curriculum is highly effective, increasing the intelligence of learners by 1-5 IQ points per year. We therefore hypothesized that in some cases learners may not be able to choose the optimal curriculum if the benefits will only be apparent with hindsight. To test this we created a network and task for which curriculumlearning was important, with a main and a supporting task. By exhaustively evaluating many training regimes, we found that an intermediate quantity of supporting task training was optimal. We then investigated under what conditions the network itself could determine the optimal moment for switching using only the data available during a single training run. We found that neither main nor supporting task performance or their gradients, nor Fisher information provided a signal thatcould guide active learning. This highlights the limitations of active learning, which may not be a viable strategy for some tasks in which the benefits of the chosen curriculum may not be apparent until much later. We speculate this is especially true for tasks with complex hierarchies of features.",,,,,
SA-279,Task Uncertainty Loss Reduce Negative Transfer in Asymmetric Multi-task Feature Learning,Rafael Peres da Silva|Chayaporn Suphavilai|Niranjan Nagarajan,"Multi-task learning (MTL) is frequently used in settings where a target task has to be learnt based on limited training data, but knowledge can be leveraged from related auxiliary tasks. While MTL can improve task performance overall relative to single-task learning (STL), these improvements can hide negative transfer (NT), where STL may deliver better performance for many individual tasks. Asymmetric multi-task feature learning (AMTFL) is an approach that tries to address this by allowing tasks with higher loss values to have smaller influence on feature representations for learning other tasks. Task loss values do not necessarily indicate reliability of models for a specific task. We present examples of NT in two orthogonal datasets (image recognition and pharmacogenomics) and tackle this challenge by using homoscedastic uncertainty to capture the relative confidence between tasks, and set weights for task loss. Our results show that this approach reduces NT providing a new approach to enable robust MTL.",,,,,
SA-280,Early Prediction of Children’s Task Completion in a Tablet Tutor using Visual Features,Bikram Boote|Mansi Agarwal|Jack Mostow,"Intelligent tutoring systems could benefit from human teachers’ ability to monitor students’ affective states by watching them and thereby detecting early warning signs of disengagement in time to prevent it. Toward that goal, this paper describes a method that uses input from a tablet tutor’s user-facing camera to predict whether the student will complete the current activity or disengage from it. Training a disengagement predictor is useful not only in itself but also in identifying visual indicators of negative affective states even when they don’t lead to non-completion of the task. Unlike prior work that relied on tutor-specific features, the method relies solely on visual features and so could potentially apply to other tutors. We present a deep learning method to make such predictions based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model that uses a target replication loss function. We train and test the model on screen capture videos of children in Tanzania using a tablet tutor to learn basic Swahili literacy and numeracy. We achieve balanced-class-size prediction accuracy of 73.3% when 40% of the activity is still left.",,,,,
SA-283,Gradient-Based Localization and Spatial Attention in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Confidence Measure in Fine-Grained Recognition,Charles Kantor|Brice Rauby|Léonard Boussioux|Emmanuel Jehanno|Hugues Talbot,"While the basic methods of image classification are bench-marked on large databases of widely varying objects, many AI real-world applications require advanced, fine-grained classification, to distinguish between items with similar global patterns, like insects or birds, but that differ by small details.  Therefore, we propose in this paper to use attention and segmentation methods to distinguish foreground from background and to use this as a confidence measure, based on the overlap between the segmentation and the attention masks. We show that confidence in the classification grows as this overlap increases. This confidence and identification tools are of practical interest in biology for automated wildlife recognition and we focus on the butterfly classification. Our tools are currently deployed in the real-world on widely used crowdsourcing platforms and museums to annotate large scale data efficiently and engage citizen scientists.",,,,,

Though seemingly an easy task for humans, it is challenging for machines as it requires the ability to comprehend the image (computer vision) and consequently generate a human-like description for the image (natural language understanding). In recent times, encoder-decoder based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results for image captioning. Here, we present a heuristic of beam search on top of the encoder-decoder based architecture that gives better quality captions on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.",,,,,

Our proposed attack finds candidate words by taking into consideration the information of both the original word and its surrounding context. It jointly leverages masked language modelling and next sentence prediction for context understanding. In comparison to attacks in prior literature, we are able to generate high quality adversarial examples that too by doing significantly better in terms of success rate and word perturbation percentage.",,,,,

We discuss a preliminary approach to realize our idea, and we conclude by pointing out some optimizations as our ongoing pursuit.",,,,,

SA-297,Two-Sided Fairness in Non-Personalised Recommendations,Aadi Swadipto Mondal|Rakesh Bal|Sayan Sinha|Gourab K Patro,"Recommender systems are one of the most widely used services on several online platforms to suggest potential items to the end-users. These services often use different machine learning techniques for which fairness is a concerning factor, especially when the downstream services have the ability to cause social ramifications. Thus, focusing on the non-personalised (global) recommendations in news media platforms (e.g., top-k trending topics on Twitter, top-k news on a news platform, etc.), we discuss on two specific fairness concerns together (traditionally studied separately)— user fairness and organisational fairness. While user fairness captures the idea of representing the choices of all the individual users in the case of global recommendations, organisational fairness tries to ensure politically/ideologically balanced recommendation sets. This makes user fairness a user side requirement and organisational fairness a platform side requirement. For user fairness, we test with methods from social choice theory, i.e., various voting rules known to better represent user choices in their results. Even in our application of voting rules to the recommendation setup, we observe high user satisfaction scores. Now for organisational fairness, we propose a bias metric which measures the aggregate ideological bias of a recommended set of items (articles). Analysing the results obtained from voting rule-based recommendation, we find that while the well-known voting rules are better from the user side, they show high bias values and clearly not suitable for organisational requirements of the platforms. Thus, there is a need to build an encompassing mechanism by cohesively bridging ideas of user fairness and organisational fairness. In this abstract paper, we intend to frame the elementary ideas along with the clear motivation behind the requirement of such a mechanism.",,,,,

SA-300,A New Robust Subspace Recovery Algorithm,Guihong Wan|Haim Schweitzer,"A common task in data analysis is to compute an approximate embedding of the data in a low dimensional subspace. This is used, for example, for dimensionality reduction. Robust Subspace Recovery computes the embedding by ignoring a fraction of the data considered as outliers. Its performance can be evaluated by how accurate the inliers (non-outliers) are represented. We propose a new algorithm that outperforms the current state of the art when the data is dominated by outliers. The main idea is to rank each point by evaluating the change in the global PCA error when that point is considered an outlier. We show that this lookahead procedure can be implemented efficiently by centered rank-one modification.",,,,,

SA-305,Measuring Vegetation Density in Marsh Grass Photographs Using Deep Neural Networks,Lucas Welch|Xudong Liu,"To protect the world’s marshlands, it is of utmost importance to be able to monitor their vegetation composition and coverage. This currently is accomplishedby large teams of researchers and volunteers manuallylooking at the marsh images and labeling randomly selected pixels by what species (or lack thereof) is presentat the pixel. This task, however, is extremely labor intensive, limiting the amount of quality environmentalmonitoring that can be done in the field. If the taskwas automated, teams would be able to monitor largerswaths of land. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for such automation using deep neural networks.Then, we focus on the key component of this framework: a binary classifier to decide whether a pixel isvegetated or not. To this end, we create a dataset of labeled snippet images out of publicly available photoquadrats of the marshlands in Florida. Finally, we construct LeNet-5 and AlexNet networks and experimentto learn them on our dataset for the binary classificationtask. Our results show that the AlexNet model achieveshigher accuracy on the test set than the LeNet-5 model,with 92.4% for AlexNet and 91.34% for LeNet-5.",,,,,
SA-306,Demonstrating the Equivalence of List-Based and Aggregate Metrics to Measure the Diversity of Recommendations (Student Abstract),Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema,"The evaluation of recommender systems is frequently focused on accuracy metrics, but this is only part of the picture. The diversity of recommendations is another important dimension that has received renewed interest in recent years.It is known that accuracy and diversity can be conflicting goals and finding appropriate ways to combine them is still an open research question. Several ways have been proposed to measure the diversity of recommendations and to include its optimization in the loss function used to train the model. Methods optimizing list-based diversity suffer from two drawbacks: the high computational cost of the loss function and the lack of an efficient way to optimize them.In this paper we show the equivalence of the list-based diversity metrics Hamming and Mean Inter-List diversity to the aggregate diversity metric measured with the Herfindahl index, providing a formulation that allows to compute and optimize them easily.",,,,,

SA-309,EC-GAN: Low-Sample Classification using Semi-Supervised Algorithms and GANs,Ayaan Haque,"Semi-supervised learning is gaining interest because it addresses classification tasks with limited labeled data. Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable and unattainable. Thus, we propose an algorithm titled EC-GAN, or the External Classifier GAN, that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN to generate artificial data, which supplements supervised classification. More specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the GAN’s generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator. We show our algorithm performs comparably to the shared architecture method and strongly a small, realistic chest X-ray dataset.",,,,,

Besides, we compute a measure of skill importance for each occupation in each country, the Revealed Comparative Advantage (rca).

Past works in this field have tried using various data imputation techniques to fill in the missing data, or training neural networks (NNs) with the missing data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach that clusters similar input features together using hierarchical clustering and then trains proportionately split neural networks with a joint loss. We evaluate this approach on a series of benchmark datasets and show promising improvements even with simple imputation techniques. We attribute this to learning through clusters of similar features in our model architecture. The source code is available at https://github.com/usarawgi911/Robustness-to-Missing-Features",,,,,
SA-349,An Unfair Affinity Toward Fairness: Characterizing 70 Years of Social Biases in B$^{H}$ollywood,Kunal Khadilkar|Ashiqur Khudabuksh,"Bollywood, aka the Mumbai film industry, is one of the biggest movie industries in the world with a current movie market share of worth 2.1 billion dollars and a target audience base of 1.2 billion people. While the entertainment impact in terms of lives that Bollywood can potentially touch is mammoth, no NLP study on social biases in Bollywood content exists. We thus seek to understand social biases in a developing country through the lens of popular movies. Our argument is simple --  popular movie content reflects social norms and beliefs in some form or shape. We present our preliminary findings on a longitudinal corpus of English subtitles of  popular Bollywood movies focusing on (1) social bias toward a fair skin color (2) gender biases, and (3) gender representation. We contrast our findings with a similar corpus of Hollywood movies. Surprisingly, we observe that much of the biases we report in our preliminary experiments on the Bollywood corpus, also gets reflected in the Hollywood corpus.",,,,,

Specifically, the 1st-phase prediction uses the extracted phrases as assistance to generate an initial question.

SA-372,Reinforcement Based Learning on Classification Task Yields Better Generalization and Adversarial Accuracy,Shashi Kant Gupta,"Deep  Learning has become interestingly popular in the field of computer vision, mostly attaining near or above human-level performance in various vision tasks.  But recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial examples (adversarial examples - inputs to a model which are naturally similar to original data but fools the model in classifying it into a wrong class). In this work, we proposed a novel method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient method in reinforcement learning to train our model instead of conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on cifar10 dataset showed that our method outperforms the same model architecture trained using cross-entropy loss function (on adversarial training). At the same time, our method generalizes better to the training data with the difference in test accuracy and train accuracy <2% for most of the time as compared to cross-entropy one, whose difference most of the time remains >2%.",,,,,
SA-374,LB-DESPOT: Efficient Online POMDP Planning Considering Lower Bound in Action Selection,Chenyang Wu|Rui Kong|Guoyu Yang|Xianghan Kong|Zongzhang Zhang|Yang Yu|Dong Li|Wulong Liu,"Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is an extension to MDP. It handles the state uncertainty by specifying the probability of getting a particular observation given the current state. DESPOT is one of the most popular scalable online planning algorithms for POMDPs, which manages to significantly reduce the size of decision tree while deriving a near-optimal policy by considering only $K$ scenarios. Nevertheless, there is a gap of action selection criteria between planning and execution in DESPOT. During the planning stage, it keeps choosing the action the with the highest upper bound, whereas when the planning ends, the action with the highest lower bound is chosen for execution. Here, we propose LB-DESPOT to alleviate this issue, which utilizes the lower bound in selecting an action branch to expand. Empirically, our method has attained better performance than DESPOT and POMCP, which is another the-state-of-art, on several challenging POMDP benchmark tasks.",,,,,
SA-375,Improving the Morphology and Control Policy of Self-reconfiguring Modular Robots in  Dynamic Environment,Dong Xue|Qiang Lu|Jian Li,"Ideally, self-reconfiguration modular robots (SMR) can change its morphology and perform actions related to a specific task in any scene. However, most SMRs only adapt to several specific known scenes because their morphology and control policies are designed or trained based on these scenes. When these policies meet an unknown scene, especially multiply unknown scenes (called dynamic environment), they will be useless.Although some of these policies import evolutionary algorithms to enhance the ability of SMR to explore unknown scenes, they are very time-consuming. The reason is that individual fitness depends on the interaction between SMR and these scenes. To address the time-consuming problem, we propose a two-stage reconfiguration algorithm (TSRA) without any prior knowledge. In the two stages, the reconfiguration methods both use the evolutionary algorithm (GA) to generate scene-fitted morphology and actions simultaneously. The first stage method uses the estimation neural network to evaluate the individual fitness to run faster and can recommend better policies to the second stage. The second stage method obtains this fitness from scenes and updates the neural network to approximate these scenes. Through experiments, TSRA can find better morphology and control policies than the other two canonical algorithms --- GA and GEM-RL.",,,,,

YouTube did not give further specific reason, and the channel got reinstated within 24 hours. However, Radic speculated that given the current political situation, a referral to ``black against white'', albeit in the context of chess, earned him this temporary ban. In this paper, via a substantial corpus of 681,995 comments, on 8,818 YouTube videos hosted by five highly popular chess-focused YouTube channels, we ask the following research question: \emph{how robust are off-the-shelf hate-speech classifiers to out-of-domain adversarial examples?} We release a data set of 1,000 annotated comments where existing hate speech classifiers misclassified benign chess discussions as hate speech. We conclude with an intriguing analogy result on racial bias with our findings pointing out to the broader challenge of color polysemy.",,,,,
SA-380,Comparing Symbolic Models of Language via Bayesian Inference,Annika Heuser|Polina Tsvilodub,"Given recurring interest in structured representations in computational cognitive models, we extend a Bayesian scoring procedure for comparing symbolic models of language grammar. We conduct a case-study of modeling syntactic principles in German, providing preliminary results consistent with linguistic theory; we also note that data set and part of speech(POS) tagger quality should not be taken for granted.",,,,,
SA-381,Automatic Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithm Selector,Jingyao Ren|Vikraman Sathiyanarayanan|Eric Ewing|Baskin Senbaslar|Nora Ayanian,"Solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems optimally is known to be NP-Hard for both make-span and total arrival time minimization. Many algorithms have been developed to solve MAPF problems optimally and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. There is no dominating MAPF solver that works well in all types of problems and no standard guidelines for when to use which solver. Therefore, there is a need for developing an automatic algorithm selector that suggests the best optimal solver to use given a MAPF problem instance. We propose a model based on convolutions and inception modules by treating the input MAPF instance as an image. We further show that techniques such as image annotation and graph embedding are very effective for improving training quality. We evaluate our model and show that it outperforms all individual algorithms in its portfolio, as well as an existing state-of-the-art MAPF algorithm selector.",,,,,
SA-385,Incorporating Curiosity into Personalized Ranking for Collaborative Filtering,Qiqi Ding|Yi Cai|Ke Xu|Huakui Zhang,"Curiosity affects users' selections of items, and it motivates them to explore the items regardless of their interests.This phenomenon is particularly common in social networks.However, the existing social-based recommendation methods neglect such feature in social network, and it may cause the accuracy decease in recommendation.What's more, only focusing on simulating the users' preferences  can lead to information cocoons.In order to tackle the problem, we propose a novel Curiosity Enhanced Bayesian Personalized Ranking (CBPR) model.Our model makes full use of the theories of psychology to model the users' curiosity aroused when facing different opinions.The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advantages of our CBPR model over the existing models.",,,,,
SA-386,Sampling Partial Acyclic Orientations in Chordal Graphs by the Lov  asz Local Lemma,Wenbo Sun|Ivona Bezakova,"Sampling of various types of acyclic orientations of chordal graphs plays a central role in several AI applications. In this work we investigate the use of the recently proposed general partial rejection sampling technique of Guo, Jerrum, and Liu, based on the Lovasz Local Lemma, for sampling partial acyclic orientations. For a given undirected graph, an acyclic orientation is an assignment of directions to all of its edges so that there is no directed cycle. In partial orientations some edges are allowed to be undirected. We show how the technique can be used to sample partial acyclic orientations of chordal graphs fast and with a clearly specified underlying distribution. This is in contrast to other samplers of various acyclic orientations with running times exponentially dependent on the maximum degree of the graph.",,,,,
SA-388,Mining Intelligent Patterns using SVAC for Precision Agriculture and Optimizing Irrigation,Vishal Vinod|Vipul Gaurav|Tushar Sharma|Savita Choudhary,"The ability to leverage the advances in precision agricul-ture, computer vision and edge devices can immensely benefit sustainable agriculture yield. Utilizing the availa-ble resources to their maximum requires reliable and intel-ligent real-time insights to both optimize and automate the current agriculture infrastructure. In some countries with low internet penetration rates, such systems need to be of-fline and extremely efficient edge deployments. We pro-pose a framework that attends to the trifecta of: (i) pre-dicting crop water requirements and irrigating the land ap-propriately, (ii) providing intelligent insights from aerial images and sensor data for crop management that is fully offline, and (iii) effective post-training quantization and model pruning that leveraging the lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle, Jonathan, and Carbin, Michael 2018) for shrink-ing the machine learning models and improving latency on the edge backend.",,,,,
SA-390,MMIM: An Interpretable Regularization Method for Neural Networks,Nan Xie|Yuexian Hou,"In deep learning models, most of network architectures are designed artificially and empirically. Although adding new structures such as convolution kernels in CNN is widely used, there are few methods to design new structures and mathematical tools to evaluate feature representation capabilities of new structures. Inspired by ensemble learning, we propose an interpretable regularization method named Minimize Mutual Information Method(MMIM), which minimize the generalization error by minimizing the mutual information of hidden neurons. The experimental results also verify the effectiveness of our proposed MMIM.",,,,,
SA-392,LAMS: A Location-aware Approach for Multimodal Summarization,Zhengkun Zhang|Jun Wang|Zhe Sun|Zhenglu Yang,"Multimodal summarization aims to refine salient information from multiple modalities, among which texts and images are two mostly discussed ones. In recent years, many fantastic works have emerged in this field by modeling image-text interactions; however, they neglect the fact that most of multimodal documents have been elaborately organized by their writers. This means that a critical organized factor has long been short of enough attention, that is, image locations, which may carry illuminating information and imply the key contents of a document. To address this issue, we propose a location-aware approach for multimodal summarization (LAMS) based on Transformer. We investigate image locations for multimodal summarization via a stack of multimodal fusion block, which can formulate the high-order interactions among images and texts. An extensive experimental study on an extended multimodal dataset validates the superior summarization performance of the proposed model.",,,,,
SA-396,Pedestrian’s Intention Recognition:  Fusion of Handcrafted Features in a Deep Learning Approach,Omar Hamed|H. Joe Steinhauer,"The safety of vulnerable road users (VRU) is a major concern for both advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle manufacturers. To guarantee people safety on roads, autonomous vehicles must be able to detect the presence of pedestrians, track them, and predict their intention to cross the road. Most of the earlier work on pedestrian intention recognition focused on using either handcrafted features or an end-to-end deep learning approach. In this project, we investigate the impact of fusing handcrafted features with auto learned features by using a two-stream neural network architecture. Our results show that the combined approach improves the performance. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms recent pedestrian intention prediction approaches on the JAAD dataset. Depending on if we considered only the immediate image frames  before  or  image frames half a second before the crossing, we received prediction accuracy of 90%, and 84%, respectively.",,,,,
SA-397,Learning to Enhance Visual Quality via Hyperspectral Domain Mapping,Harsh Sinha|Aditya Mehta|Murari Mandal|Pratik Narang,"Deep learning based methds have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and enhancement, but a majority of such methods rely on RGB input images. These methods fail to take into account the rich spectral distribution of natural images. We propose a deep architecture, SpecNet which computes spectral profile to estimate pixel-wise dynamic range adjustment of a given image. First, we employ an unpaired cycle-consistent framework to generate hyperspectral images (HSI) from low-light input images. HSI are further used to generate a normal light image of the same scene. In order to infer a plausible HSI from a RGB image we incorporate a self-supervision and a spectral profile regularization network. We evaluate the benefits of optimizing the spectral profile for real and fake images in low-light conditions on the LOL Dataset.",,,,,
SA-400,Change or Not: A Simple Approach for Plug And Play Language Models on Sentiment Control,Chen Xu|Jianyu Zhao|Rang Li|Changjian Hu|Chuangbai Xiao,"Text generation with sentiment control is difficult without fine-tuning or modifying the model architecture. Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) utilizes an external sentiment classifier to update the hidden states of GPT-2 at each time step without any changes for model parameters but achieves competitive performance. In the meanwhile, fluency is impaired due to the instability of the hidden embedding. Moreover, the classifier is not strong as it is trained with partial texts, hence it's difficult to guide the generation in the middle. In this paper, we first propose a fixed threshold method to decide whether to change a word or not, which keeps the fluency of the original LM. And for the improvement of sentiment alignment, we further propose an adaptive threshold method that utilizes VAD-based loss to make the threshold dynamic. Experiments demonstrated that our methods beat the baseline with a great margin significantly both on fluency and sentiment accuracy.",,,,,
SA-403,Enhancing Context-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithms via An Efficient Task Encoder,Feng Xu|Shengyi Jiang|Hao Yin|Zongzhang Zhang|Yang Yu|Ming Li|Dong Li|Wulong Liu,"Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to adapt to new tasks from small amounts of exploration, based on the experience of similar tasks. Recent studies have pointed out that a good representation of a task is key to the success of off-policy context-based meta-RL. Inspired by contrastive methods in unsupervised representation learning, we propose a new method to learn the task representation based on the mutual information between transition tuples in a trajectory and the task embedding. We also propose a newestimation for task similarity based on Q-function, which can be used to form a constraint on the distribution of the encoded task variables, making the task encoder to encode the task variables more effective on new tasks. Experiments on meta-RL tasks show that the newly proposed method outperforms existing meta-RL algorithms.",,,,,
SA-406,State-Wise Adaptive Discounting from Experience (SADE):\\ A Novel Discounting Scheme for Reinforcement Learning,Milan Zinzuvadiya|Vahid Behzadan,"In Markov Decision Process (MDP) models of sequential decision-making, it is common practice to account for temporal discounting by incorporating a constant discount factor. While the effectiveness of fixed-rate discounting in various Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings is well-established, the efficiency of this scheme has been questioned in recent studies. (\cite{DiscountedRLNotOPtimize}) establishes that in RL environments with continuous tasks, the stationary formulation of discounted RL is not an optimization problem. Another notable shortcoming of fixed-rate discounting stems from abstracting away the experiential information of the agent, which is shown to be a significant component of delay discounting in human cognition. To address this issue, we propose State-wise Adaptive Discounting from Experience (SADE) as a novel adaptive discounting scheme for RL agents. SADE leverages the experiential observations of state values in episodic trajectories to iteratively adjust state-specific discount rates. We report experimental evaluations of SADE in Q-learning agents, which demonstrate significant enhancement of sample complexity and convergence rate compared to fixed-rate discounting.",,,,,
SA-407,Reward based Hebbian Learning in Direct Feedback Alignment,Ashlesha Akella|Sai Kalyan Ranga Singanamalla|Chin-Teng Lin,"Imparting biological realism during the learning process is gaining attention towards producing computationally efficient algorithms without compromising the performance. Feedback alignment and mirror neuron concept are two such approaches where the feedback weight remains static in the former and update via Hebbian learning in the later. Though these approaches have proven to work efficiently for supervised learning, it remained unknown if the same can be applicable to reinforcement learning applications. Therefore, this study introduces RHebb-DFA where the reward-based Hebbian learning is used to update feedback weights in direct feedback alignment mode. This approach is validated on various Atari games and obtained equivalent performance in comparison with DDQN.",,,,,
SA-411,Muiti-modal User Intent Classification Under the Scenario of Smart Factory,Yu-Ching Chiu|Bo-Hao Chang|Tzu-Yu Chen|Cheng-Fu Yang|Richard Tzong-Han Tsai|Hung-Yi Lee|Jane Yung-Jen Hsu,"Question-answering systems are becoming increasingly popular in Natural Language Processing, especially when applied in smart factory settings. A common practice in designing those systems is through intent classification. However, in a multiple-stage task commonly seen in those settings, relying solely on intent classification may lead to erroneous answers, as questions rising from different work stages may share the same intent but have different contexts and therefore require different answers. To address this problem, we designed an interactive dialogue system that utilizes contextual information to assist intent classification in a multiple-stage task. Specifically, our system incorporates user’s utterances with real-time video feed to better situate users’ questions and analyze their intent.",,,,,
SA-413,Evaluating Meta-Reinforcement Learning through a HVAC Control Benchmark,Yashvir Singh Grewal|Frits de Nijs|Sarah Goodwin,"Meta-Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to leverage prior task experience to quickly learn new unseen tasks. Unfortunately, evaluating meta-RL algorithms is com- plicated by a lack of suitable benchmarks. In this paper we propose adapting a challenging real-world heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) control benchmark for meta-RL. Unlike existing benchmark problems, HVAC control has a broader task distribution, and sources of exogenous stochasticity from price and weather predictions which can be shared across task definitions. This can enable greater differentiation between the performance of current meta-RL approaches, and open the way for future research into algorithms that can adapt to entirely new tasks not sampled from the current task distribution.",,,,,
SA-414,Neuro-Symbolic Techniques for Description Logic Reasoning,Gunjan Singh|Sutapa Mondal|Sumit Bhatia|Raghava Mutharaju,"Motivated  by  the  need  for  reasoning  approaches  that  can scale  well  even  on  the  most  expressive,  and  large  ontolo-gies, neuro-symbolic approaches have received major atten-tion in recent times. The idea is to combine the robustness and  learning  capabilities  of  the  artificial  neural  networks along with the precise reasoning abilities of logic-based approaches. In relation to this theme, we discuss two approaches that we  are  currently  working  on:  an  ontology-based  embedding  model  for  theories  in EL++ description  logic  and  a reinforcement learning-based solution for efficient tableau-based reasoning  for  description  logic. We describe promising initial results of our efforts towards these directions and lay down the direction for future work.",,,,,
SA-416,NEAP-F: Network Epoch Accuracy Prediction Framework,Arushi Chauhan|Dr. Mayank Vatsa|Dr. Richa Singh,"Recent work in neural architecture search has spawned interest in algorithms that can predict the performance of convolutional neural networks using minimum time and computation resources. We propose a new framework, Network Epoch Accuracy Prediction Framework (NEAP-F) which can predict the testing accuracy achieved by a convolutional neural network in one or more epochs. We introduce a novel approach to generate vector representations for networks, and encode ``ease"" of classifying image datasets into a vector. For vector representations of networks, we focus on the layer parameters and connections between the network layers. A network achieves different accuracies on different image datasets; therefore, we use the image dataset characteristics to create a vector signifying the ``ease"" of classifying the image dataset. After generating these vectors, the prediction models are trained with architectures having skip connections seen in current state-of-the-art architectures. The framework predicts accuracies in order of milliseconds, demonstrating its computational efficiency. It can be easily applied to neural architecture search methods to predict the performance of candidate networks and can work on unseen datasets as well.",,,,,
SA-417,Shallow-UWnet: Compressed Model for Underwater Image Enhancement,Ankita Naik|Kartik Mittal|Apurva Swarnakar,"Over the past few decades, underwater image enhancement has attracted increasing amount of research effort due to its significance in underwater robotics and ocean engineering. Research has evolved from implementing physics-based solutions to using very deep CNNs and GANs. However, these state-of-art algorithms are computationally expensive and memory intensive. This hinders their deployment on portable devices for underwater exploration tasks. These models are trained on either synthetic or limited real world datasets making them less practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper we propose a shallow neural network architecture, \textbf{Shallow-UWnet} which maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art models. We also demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its performance on combination of synthetic and real-world datasets.",,,,,

We propose a novel active learning algorithm (Triplet AL) which uses a triplet network to select samples from unlabeled set. Previous active learning methods rely on classification model's final prediction scores as a measure of confidence for an unlabeled sample. We propose a more reliable confidence measure called Top-Two-Margin which is given by Triplet Network. The Proposed algorithm outperforms other active learning approaches which are used to compare in our research",,,,,
SA-421,Text Embedding Bank for Detailed Image Paragraph Captioning,Arjun Gupta|Zack Shen|Thomas Huang,"Existing deep learning-based models for image caption-ing typically consist of an image encoder to extract visu-al features and a language model decoder, an architecture that has shown promising results in single high-level sentence generation. However, only the word-level guid-ing signal is available when the image encoder is opti-mized to extract visual features. The inconsistency be-tween the parallel extraction of visual features and se-quential text supervision limits its success when the length of the generated text is long (more than 50 words). We propose a new module, called the Text Embedding Bank (TEB), to address this problem for image paragraph captioning. This module uses the paragraph vector model to learn fixed-length feature representations from a varia-ble-length paragraph. We refer to the fixed-length feature as the TEB. This TEB module plays two roles to benefit paragraph captioning performance. First, it acts as a form of global and coherent deep supervision to regularize visual feature extraction in the image encoder. Second, it acts as a distributed memory to provide features of the whole paragraph to the language model, which alleviates the long-term dependency problem. Adding this module to two existing state-of-the-art methods achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the paragraph captioning Stan-ford Visual Genome dataset.",,,,,
SA-436,Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis for Code-mixed Data,Siddharth Yadav|Tanmoy Chakraborty,"Code-mixing  is  the  practice  of  alternating  between  two  ormore languages.
