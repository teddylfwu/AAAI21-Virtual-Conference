  title: "W6: Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CSKGs)"
  organizers: Filip Ilievski, Alessandro Oltramari, Deborah McGuinness and Pedro Szekely
  abstract: Commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs) are sources of background knowledge that are expected to contribute to downstream tasks like question answering, robot manipulation, and planning. The knowledge covered in CSKGs varies greatly, spanning procedural, conceptual, and syntactic knowledge, among others. CSKGs come in a wider variety of forms compared to traditional knowledge graphs, ranging from (semi-)structured knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet, ATOMIC, and FrameNet, to the recent idea to use language models as knowledge graphs. As a consequence, traditional methods of integration and usage of knowledge graphs might need to be expanded when dealing with CSKGs. Understanding how to best integrate and represent CSKGs, leverage them on a downstream task, and tailor their knowledge to the particularities of the task, are open challenges today. The workshop on CSKGs addresses these challenges, by focusing on the creation of commonsense knowledge graphs and their usage on downstream commonsense reasoning tasks.

  abstract: Deep Learning models are at the core of research in Artificial Intelligence research today. It is well-known that deep learning techniques that were disruptive for Euclidean data such as images or sequence data such as text are not immediately applicable to graph-structured data. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs on various tasks such as graph representation learning, graph generation, and graph classification. New neural network architectures on graph-structured data have achieved remarkable performance in these tasks when applied to domains such as social networks, bioinformatics and medical informatics.

  organizers: "Prashan Madumal, Silvia Tulli, David Aha and Rosina Weber"
  abstract: As artificial intelligence has become tightly intervened in the society having tangible consequences and influence, calls for explainability and interpretability of these systems has also become increasingly prevalent. Explainable AI (XAI) attempts to alleviate concerns of transparency, trust and ethics in AI by making them accountable, interpretable and explainable to humans. This workshop aims to encapsulate these concepts under the umbrella of Explainable Agency and bring together researchers and practitioners working in different facets of explainable AI from diverse backgrounds to share challenges, new directions and recent research in the field. We especially welcome research from fields including but not limited to artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, cognitive science, human factors and philosophy.

  organizers: Balaraman Ravindran, Kristian Kersting, Sarika Jalan, Partha Pratim Talukdar, Sriraam Natarajan, Tarun Kumar, Deepak Maurya, Nikita Moghe, Naganand Yadati, Jeshuren Chelladurai and Aparna Rai
  abstract: The study of complex graphs is a highly interdisciplinary field that aims to study complex systems by using mathematical models, physical laws, inference and learning algorithms, etc. Complex systems are often characterized by several components that interact in multiple ways among each other. Such systems are better modeled by complex graph structures such as edge and vertex labelled graphs (e.g., knowledge graphs), attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, hypergraphs, temporal / dynamic graphs, etc. In this GCLR (Graphs and more Complex structures for Learning and Reasoning) workshop, we will focus on various complex structures along with inference and learning algorithms for these structures. The current research in this area is focused on extending existing ML algorithms as well as network science measures to these complex structures. This workshop aims to bring researchers from these diverse but related fields together and embark on interesting discussions on new challenging applications that require complex system modeling and discovering ingenious reasoning methods. We have invited several distinguished speakers with their research interest spanning from the theoretical to experimental aspects of complex networks.

  organizers: "Martin Michalowski, Arash Shaban-Nejad, Cochair, Szymon Wilk, David L. Buckeridge, John S. Brownstein, Byron C. Wallace and Michael J. Paul"
  abstract: Public health authorities and researchers collect data from many sources and analyze these data together to estimate the incidence and prevalence of different health conditions, as well as related risk factors. Modern surveillance systems employ tools and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor direct and indirect signals and indicators of disease activities for early, automatic detection of emerging outbreaks and other health-relevant patterns. To provide proper alerts and timely response, public health officials and researchers systematically gather news and other reports about suspected disease outbreaks, bioterrorism, and other events of potential international public health concern, from a wide range of formal and informal sources. Given the ever-increasing role of the World Wide Web as a source of information in many domains including healthcare, accessing, managing, and analyzing its content has brought new opportunities and challenges. This is especially the case for non- traditional online resources such as social networks, blogs, news feed, twitter posts, and online communities with the sheer size and ever-increasing growth and change rate of their data. Web applications along with text processing programs are increasingly being used to harness online data and information to discover meaningful patterns identifying emerging health threats. The advances in web science and technology for data management, integration, mining, classification, filtering, and visualization has given rise to a variety of applications representing real-time data on epidemics.

  title: 'W15: Imagining Post-COVID Education with AI'
  organizers: "Paul Kim, Neil Hefferman, Jineon Baek, Hoonpyo Jeon, Byungsoo Kim, Jamin Shin, Dongmin Shin and Youngduck Choi"
  abstract: COVID-19 has brought upon us the inevitable transformation towards virtual education. The ensuing need for scalable, personalized learning systems has led to an unprecedented demand for understanding large-scale educational data. However, the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has received relatively little academic attention compared to the mainstream machine learning areas like vision, natural language processing, and healthcare. In this workshop, we plan to invite AIEd enthusiasts from all around the world through three different channels. First, we will call for papers related to important AIEd topics that can help us imagine what new education will look like. Second, we propose a shared task about various AIEd problems on the largest public dataset, EdNet, which contains 123M interactions from more than 1M students. Finally, we host a global challenge on Kaggle for a fair comparison of state-of-the-art Knowledge Tracing models and invite technical reports from winning teams. Through these initiatives, we aim to provide a common ground for researchers to share their cutting-edge insights on AIEd and encourage the development of practical and large-scale AIEd methods of lasting impact.

  organizers: "Xiaomo Liu, Zhiqiang Ma, Manuela M. Veloso, Sameena Shah, Armineh Nourbakhsh, Gerard de Melo, Le Song and Quanzhi Li"
  abstract: Knowledge discovery from various data sources has gained the attention of many practitioners over the past decades. Its capabilities have expanded from processing structured data (e.g. DB transactions) to unstructured data (e.g. text, images, and videos). In spite of substantial research focusing on discovery from news, web, and social media data, its application to data in professional settings such as legal documents, financial filings, and government reports, still present huge challenges. Possible reasons are that the precision and recall requirements for extracted knowledge to be used in business processes are fastidious, and signals gathered from these knowledge discovery tasks are usually very sparse and thus the generation of supervision signals is quite challenging.

  organizers: Scott E. Fahlman, Kate Farrahi, George Magoulas, Edouard Oyallon, Bhiksha Raj Ramakrishnan and Dean Alderucci
  abstract: A fundamental problem in the use of artificial neural networks is that the first step is to guess the network architecture. Fine tuning a neural network is very time consuming and far from optimal. Hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of nodes in each layer, the pattern of connectivity, and the presence and placement of elements such as memory cells, recurrent connections, and convolutional elements are all manually selected. If it turns out that the architecture is not appropriate for the task, the user must repeatedly adjust the architecture and retrain the network until an acceptable architecture has been obtained.

  title: "W18: Meta-Learning and Co-Hosted Competition"
  organizers: Adrian El Baz, Isabelle Guyon, Zhengying Liu, Jan N. van Rijn, Sebastien Treguer and Joaquin Vanschoren
  abstract: The performance of many machine learning algorithms depends highly upon the quality and quantity of available data, and (hyper)-parameter settings. In particular, deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, are known to be ‘data-hungry,’ and require properly tuned hyper-parameters. Meta-Learning is a way to address both issues. Simple, but effective approaches reported recently include pre-training models on similar datasets. This way, a good model or good hyperparameters can be pre-determined or learned model parameters can be transferred to the new dataset. As such, higher performance can be achieved with the same amount of data, or similar performance with less data (few shot learning). This workshop, with a co-hosted competition, will focus on meta-learning and few shot learning.

  abstract: Machine learning and in particular deep learning has shown significant boost in performance on various computer vision tasks such as object recognition, face recognition, and semantic segmentation in the last decade. Despite this success, the learning mechanism of modern systems remains surprisingly narrow as compared to the way humans learn. For example, contrary to the most current systems which learn just a single model from just a single data set, we humans acquire knowledge from diverse experiences over many years. As an alternative, meta-learning and life-long learning aka never-ending learning has been emerging as a new paradigm in the machine learning literature.

  title: "W21: Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence (PPAI-21)"
  organizers: "Ferdinando Fioretto, Pascal Van Hentenryck and Richard W. Evans"
  abstract: "The availability of massive amounts of data, coupled with high-performance cloud computing platforms, has driven significant progress in artificial intelligence and, in particular, machine learning and optimization. It has profoundly impacted several areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and transportation. However, the use of rich data sets also raises significant privacy concerns: They often reveal personal sensitive information that can be exploited, without the knowledge and/or consent of the involved individuals, for various purposes including monitoring, discrimination, and illegal activities."

  title: "W22: Reasoning and Learning for Human-Machine Dialogs (DEEP-DIAL21)"
  organizers: "Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur, Ullas Nambiar, Imed Zitouni and Biplav Srivastava"
  abstract: Natural conversation is a hallmark of intelligent systems and thus dialog systems have been a key sub-area of Artificial Intelligence research for decades. Chatbots are their most recent incarnation and have been widely adopted, particularly in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, as sources of information. Given the increasing interest, there has been a surge in the development of easy-to-use platforms to rapidly create dialog agents at different levels of sophistication. Further, with the rapid advances in natural language generation models, there is a need to foster and guide the research on the development and deployment of dialog systems with what users actually value.

  title: "W23: Reinforcement Learning in Games"
  organizers: Marc Lanctot, Julien Perolat and Martin Schmid
  abstract: "Games provide an abstract and formal model of environments in which multiple agents interact: each player has a well-defined goal and rules to describe the effects of interactions among the players. The first achievements in playing these games at super-human level were attained with methods that relied on and exploited domain expertise that was designed manually (e.g. chess, checkers). In recent years, we have seen examples of general approaches that learn to play these games via self-play reinforcement learning (RL), as first demonstrated in Backgammon. While progress has been impressive, we believe we have just scratched the surface of what is capable, and much work remains to be done in order to truly understand the algorithms and learning processes within these environments."

  organizers: Thien Huu Nguyen, Walter Chang, Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh, Leo Anthony Celi and Franck Dernoncourt
  abstract: 'Scientific documents such as research papers, patents, books, or technical reports are one of the most valuable resources of human knowledge. At the AAAI-21 Workshop on Scientific Document Understanding (SDU@AAAI-21), we aim to gather insights into the recent advances and remaining challenges on scientific document understanding. Researchers from related fields are invited to submit papers on the recent advances, resources, tools, and upcoming challenges for SDU. In addition to that, we propose a shared task on one of the challenging SDU tasks, i.e., acronym identification and disambiguation in scientific text.'

  title: 'W25: Toward Robust, Secure and Efficient Machine Learning'
  organizers: "Dawn Song, Song Han, Han Yu, Lixin Fan and KamWoh Ng"
  abstract: Machine learning technology has been improving with every passing day and has been extensively applied to nearly every corner of the society that offers substantial benefits to our daily lives. However, machine learning models face various threats. For example, it is known that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial samples. The existence of adversarial examples reveals that current machine learning models are vulnerable and can be easily fooled, leading to serious security concerns in machine learning systems such as autonomous driving vehicles or face recognition systems.

  title: "W26: Trustworthy AI for Healthcare"
  organizers: Pengtao Xie, Marinka Zitnik, Byron Wallace, Jennifer G. Dy and Eric Xing
  abstract: "AI for healthcare has emerged into a very active research area in the past few years and has made significant progress. While existing results are encouraging, not too many clinical AI solutions are deployed in hospitals or actively utilized by physicians. A major problem is that existing clinical AI methods are less trustworthy. For example, existing approaches make clinical decisions in a black-box way, which renders the decisions difficult to understand and less transparent. Existing solutions are not robust to small perturbations or potentially adversarial attacks, which raises security and privacy concerns. In addition, existing methods are often biased to specific ethnic groups or subpopulations. As a result, physicians are reluctant to use these solutions since clinical decisions are mission-critical and have to be made with high trust and reliability."
