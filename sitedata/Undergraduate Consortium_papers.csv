UC-56,Evolving Spiking Circuit Motifs Using Weight Agnostic Neural Networks,Abrar Anwar,We need the whole abstract,"i.e., a link to the preprint version of each paper (probably hosted in AAAI official site). We also need a zipped file of all the papers in order to extract an image from each paper","e.g., 10:00-11:00, February 7 ","i.e., for the link https://slideslive.com/paper.SlidesLivePresentationID",Each paper has a unique GatherTownLink,We need this information if there is a paper presentation session
