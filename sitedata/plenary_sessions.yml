  abstract: "Regina Barzilay is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and \
  Computer Science and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\
  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her research interests are in natural language\
  processing. Currently, Prof. Barzilay is focused on bringing the power of machine learning to oncology. \
  In collaboration with physicians and her students, she is devising deep learning models that utilize imaging,\
  free text, and structured data to identify trends that affect early diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention.\
  Prof. Barzilay is poised to play a leading role in creating new models that advance the capacity of computers to \
  harness the power of human language data.
\n\n
    Regina Barzilay is a recipient of various awards including the MacArthur Fellowship, NSF Career Award, the MIT \
  Technology Review TR-35 Award, Microsoft Faculty Fellowship and several Best Paper Awards in top NLP conferences. \
  In 2017, she received a MacArthur fellowship, an ACL fellowship and an AAAI fellowship. Most recently, in 2020, she \
  is the first recipient of the AAAI Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity."

  abstract: "Since everything went crazy in AI, around 2012, I, like many other members of our community,\
   have frequently found myself put in the position of having to talk about our field to a non-specialist audience. \
   I’ve been interviewed on TV and radio, and spoken to endless university committees, government committees, and industrial \
   conferences. More recently, following the publication of my two popular science books (the Ladybird Expert Guide to \
   AI [2018], and The Road to Conscious Machines [2020]), I’ve even begun speaking at a literary festivals (believe me, \
   I never expected to be doing this as a PhD student studying multiagent systems back in 1989). In this talk, I will \
   relate these experiences, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them – how our field is perceived, what people\
    fear, hope, and expect from it, and how best to communicate excitement about the very real progress we’ve made recently\
     with a realistic understanding of where we are and where we are going.
